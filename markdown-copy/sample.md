###### start-subtype-content

**Important: This is a guide only**. To avoid losing marks:

Confirm the referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer, and

Use <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/citingmedicine" target="_blank">Citing medicine: the NLM style guide for authors, editors, and publishers (2nd ed.)</a> (opens in a new tab) to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.

The Vancouver referencing style is a **numbered system**, predominantly used in the medical field. Authorship is acknowledged using a number to represent a reference. From the in-text reference number, the reader may consult the reference list for full publication details.


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item

###### start-subtype-item

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- References are numbered consecutively in the order in which they first appear in the text. For example, the first source is given the number 1, the second source 2, and so on.

- Once you have given a source a number, use the same number whenever you refer to that source in the text.

- Identifying numbers are placed outside the sentence punctuation. In the text, the number appears in parentheses (either round or square) or as superscript. Examples:

> The theory was first put forward in 1987. (1)

> The theory was first put forward in 1987. [1]

> The theory was first put forward in 1987.<sup>1</sup>

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas or research and express them in your own words. The way you cite the information depends on the emphasis you wish to apply.

**Information-prominent citations** emphasise the information you have paraphrased or quoted from an author:

> . . . as evidenced from a recent Australian study. (1)

**Author-prominent citations** emphasise the author. Note: When citing a reference with **multiple authors**, list the first author, and then abbreviate subsequent authors using **et al**.

> In his research, Jones (2) asserts that . . .

> Morton et al. (2) suggest that the use of binomial control charts . . .

#### Direct quotes

Direct quotes are rarely used in the Vancouver style. However, if you use the exact wording of a source:

- include the page number in the in-text citation

- enclose short direct quotes within quotation marks

**Note**: Within the parentheses, the in-text number is followed by a space, then the lower case letter 'p' with no space and the page number.

> "The increasing availability and growth rate of biomedical information, also known as ‘big data’, provides an opportunity for future personalized medicine programs that will significantly improve patient care". (1 p433)

Quotes longer than four lines should be **indented** in a block, in **reduced type** and **without quotation marks**:

> With the increased need to store data and information generated by big projects, computational solutions, such as cloud-based computing, have emerged. Cloud computing is the only storage model that can provide the elastic scale needed for DNA sequencing, whose rate of technology advancement could now exceed Moore's Law. Moore's law is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors on integrated circuits and the speed of computers double approximately every 2 years. (1 p433)

###### start-subtype-item

### Citing multiple references at the same point in-text

###### start-subtype-content

When citing more than one reference at the same point in your text, give the relevant numbers, separated by commas. Include one space between the comma and the next number:

> A number of researchers (4, 5) discovered that . . .

> A number of researchers (3, 6, 10) discovered that . . .

If the references have **consecutive numbers**, then use a hyphen. There should be no spaces between numbers and hyphens:

> A number of researchers (4-7) discovered that . . .


###### end-subtype-content

###### start-subtype-item

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- On a new page, under the heading 'Reference List’, list the publication details of all your in-text references. The reference list should be at the end of your document.

- List references numerically in the order they first appear in the text.

- Include only those works cited in the text. List all other sources you have used separately under the heading ‘Bibliography’.

- Format the reference list to be single-spaced with one line space between each entry.

#### Titles

- Do not use italics for any titles, e.g. book titles, journal titles, titles of journal articles.

- For book titles and journal article titles, capitalise the first word and proper nouns only (i.e. use minimal capitalisation).

- For journal titles, use an abbreviated format. To find the title abbreviation, go to the PubMed database, select "Journals in NCBI Datbases", and then enter the journal’s full title to display its abbreviation.

#### Authors

For authors, begin with the family name followed by the initial(s). There are no spaces or full stops between initials (e.g. Smith AB).

Where there are six or fewer authors, list all the authors.

If there are more than six authors, list the first six followed by **et al**.

#### Place of publication

For the place of publication, add the city, and then qualify it – see below – by the state code or country name.

- **Cities in the USA and Canada**: Include the two-letter abbreviation for the state or province, e.g. St Louis (MO); Hamilton (ON).

- **Cities in other countries**: Use either the country name after all cities not in the USA or Canada, e.g. Melbourne (Australia); Oxford (England).

#### Pagination

For books in the Reference List, pagination (i.e. total number of pages) is optional. *Note: The examples in this guide do not include pagination for books.*

#### Punctuation for references ending with a URL

End citations with a full stop unless the citation ends with a URL or other electronic address.

Check:

- If the URL ends with a forward slash, end the citation with a full stop.

- If the URL does not end with a forward slash, do not end the citation with a full stop.

### General rules for referencing images

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

#### General rules

In the Vancouver style, the term “illustration” applies to anything that is not written. For example:

- images (labelled as "Figures" when included in-text)

- tables

- charts

- graphs

The following are general rules for citing illustrations – whatever the type - using the Vancouver referencing style. However, the specific examples provided in this Vancouver guide are for citing images.

#### Using numbers

The Vancouver referencing style uses Arabic numerals, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc., whenever a number is required. Do not use:

- Roman numerals, e.g. i, ii, iii

- words, e.g. one, two, three

#### In-text citations

Below the illustration you have inserted in your text, add a caption that includes:

- a label and number. The number will depend on where it appears in your text. E.g. If it is the first figure in your text, it will be labelled Figure 1.

- the description or title used in the original source

- a reference number in parentheses. This is the number that you give it according to where it appears in your text. For example, if it is the 12th source cited in your document, the reference number will be (12).

#### The reference list

In the reference list, include the sources of all the illustrations that you have used from another source and inserted in your text.

In general, this is the order that the references in your list will include:

- the reference number you gave a reference in-text

- the standard reference structure for the particular reference type source (e.g. a book)

- the figure number that was used in that original source

- the title of the illustration

- the page number where the illustration is located in the source (if available or applicable)

#### Images not numbered in the original source, e.g. image on a webpage or in a database

- If the illustration is not numbered, give it a number according to its placement on the webpage and enclose it in square brackets. For example, if it is the first illustration in the original source, give it the number 1, e.g. [Figure 1].

- If it is the only illustration given in the original source, just use [Figure].

### Student's own work

###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration" target="_blank">Assessment Declaration</a> (opens in a new tab).

The publication <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/" target="_blank">Citing Medicine</a> (opens in a new tab) on which this information is based does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following is based on how to cite dissertations and theses.

If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.

#### Paraphrasing in-text

For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:

> Studies indicate that … (24).

> Smith (24) noted that …

If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it may look like this:

> According to Smith (24), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (18) …

#### Direct quote in-text

Place direct quotes between double quotation marks " " and provide the page number from the previous work.

> "Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders". (24 p3).

#### Reference List

In the Reference list include:

- Student name

- Title of previous work

- Unpublished paper (in square brackets)

- City and Country (in square brackets)

- Institution name

- Year of previous work

- Total number of pages of previous work
