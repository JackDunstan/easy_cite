**Important: This is a guide only**. To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm the referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer, and
Use the <a href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9921781610801341" target="_blank">American Psychological Association. (2020). Publication manual of the American Psychological Association (7<sup>th</sup> ed.)</a> (opens in a new tab). to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.
APA is an **author-date** referencing style. You need to follow this style when acknowledging your information sources.

- APA style requires that all references in a document are to be cited in-text, and that all in-text citations are compiled in a reference list at the end of the document. **In-text citations** appear within the body of the document and include details such as author(s) family name, year of publication, and page number(s) (if applicable). The **reference list** must provide full details of all in-text citations, and be arranged alphabetically by author.

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- When citing a work with a single author provide the author's family name and year of publication.

- When a work has two authors, always cite both family names every time the reference occurs in the text.

- When a work has three or more authors, cite only the family name of the first author followed by **et al.** and the year of publication.

- When using exact words that an author has used, you must enclose these in double quotation marks “ ” and supply an in-text citation, including page number(s).

- In your writing, you must acknowledge each author or source of information (whether print or online) either by **paraphrasing** or using a **direct quote**.

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words. When paraphrasing, use round brackets to add the author(s) family name and the year of publication, or use the author(s) family name as part of your sentence, followed by the year of publication in round brackets.

*Note: When paraphrasing, the citation details can be used at the beginning, middle or end of the sentence.*

#### Citation at the beginning

> Brophy (2010) states that student motivation . . .

#### Citation in the middle

> . . . motivation is evident (Brophy, 2010), and as a result, can contribute significantly to achieving learning goals.

#### Citation at the end

> . . . where a number of subjective experiences can inform motivational outcomes (Brophy, 2010).

*Note: Citations can also be structured according to whether they give prominence to the author (narrative), or to the information being conveyed (parenthetical).*

#### Narrative citations

> In his research, Brophy (2010) argues that . . .

#### Parenthetical citations

> . . . findings are based on the qualitative study of behavioural learning (Brophy, 2010).

#### Including page numbers in a paraphrase citation

When paraphrasing, page numbers may also be included as part of the citation, especially if it helps the reader to locate the source of the information in a lengthy document.

*Note: Including page numbers when paraphrasing is optional and is **NOT** a requirement of the APA referencing style.*

> In order to establish a learning community in the classroom, it is important to motivate students by addressing both individual and collaborative learning goals (Brophy, 2010, pp. 23-24).

#### Direct quotes

Direct quotes are used when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between double quotation marks and add a page number. Do **NOT** overuse direct quotes.

> “Student motivation to learn can be viewed as either a general disposition or a situation-specific state” (Brophy, 2010, p. 12).

#### Citing a source with no page number(s)

If the work you are referencing does NOT contain page numbers, then use paragraph numbers, chapter numbers or section headings as part of the in-text reference.

> "As the national peak body for early childhood, ECA is a regular, and trusted, contributor to the public policy debate on all matters affecting young children (birth to eight years) and their families" (Early Childhood Australia, 2016, Advocacy section, para. 1).

#### Omitting words from a direct quote

If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots (. . .) and another space.

> Cannon (2012) argues that "changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas . . . will require coherent change strategies" (p. 165).

*Note: Quotes more than **40 words** in length need to be in **block** form – without using quotation marks, begin the quote on a new, indented line, and double-space the entire quote. At the end of the quote, include citation details such as author(s), year and page number(s) in brackets.*

>> The difference between intrinsic motivation and motivation to learn is closely related to the difference between affective and cognitive engagement experiences. Intrinsic motivation refers primarily to affective experience—enjoyment of the processes involved in engaging in an activity. In contrast, motivation to learn is primarily a cognitive experience involving attempts to make sense of the information that an activity conveys, to relate this information to prior knowledge, and to master the skills that the activity develops. (Brophy, 2010, p. 12)

### Multiple works by the same author in the same year

###### start-subtype-content

When an author has published more than one cited work in the same year, distinguish each work by using a lower case letter after the year within the brackets (this is also written in the reference list).

**Paraphrasing in-text**

> According to Dean (2017a), it was found that . . .

> It is suggested that . . . (Dean, 2017b).

**Reference list**

Identify works by the same author(s) in the same year by the suffixes a, b, c, etc. after the year.

References by the same author(s) with the same publication year are arranged alphabetically by the title (excluding A or The) that follows the date.

&nbsp;
#### Lead authors are the same in the same year

If there are more than 3 authors and the lead author(s) are the same, but there are also different contributing authors then cite all authors until a distinction can be made followed by et al.

**Paraphrasing in-text**

> Arnaiz, Cochrane, Hastie, et al. (2018) state . . .

### Secondary citation

###### start-subtype-content

A secondary citation is used when you acknowledge the work of an author that you have read about in another author’s work.

For example, if you read an article written by Hosany and Martin and they cite information from another study written by Heath and Scott, you would need to acknowledge Heath and Scott in the text:

> Heath and Scott (as cited in Hosany & Martin, 2012) claim that . . .

> Early research indicated . . . (Heath & Scott, as cited in Hosany & Martin, 2012).

In the reference list, you need to include the citation information for the Hosany and Martin article as that is where the Heath and Scott information was sourced:

> {.hanging-indent}Hosany, S., & Martin, D. (2012). Self-image congruence in consumer behavior. *Journal of Business Research*, *65*(5), 685-691. https<nolink>://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.03.015{/.hanging-indent}

###### start-subtype-item

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- A reference list is to be included at the end of your work acknowledging all sources used.

- The word 'References' should be on a new page, centred and in bold.

- The reference list is arranged alphabetically by author family name.

- If there are multiple entries by the same author, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are several authors with the same family name, then arrange alphabetically by initials.

- Where an item has no author, it is cited by its title.

- The reference list must be double-spaced and each entry should have a hanging indent on the second and subsequent lines (if applicable).

- Italicise all book titles, journal titles, volume numbers, titles of newspapers and titles of webpages and websites.

#### Digital object identifier (DOI)

#### Citing sources in a table

The information and examples below outline how to reference a table where the information in the table has been derived from another source or sources.

*Note: If a table that you create in your written work is entirely your own and does not include information from other sources, you should include a table number (in bold) and a brief title (italicised).*

*Note: If you are copying an entire table from another source without altering the layout or combining its data from other sources, you should then reference it as per the other examples in the Images section e.g. book/journal article, webpage etc.*

#### In-text citation

When citing tables in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1. within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and

2. in the table layout include table number, brief title and notes

Refer to the table by its assigned number. Do NOT refer to the table as “the Table above/below”, or “the Table on page 17”.

> As shown in Table 5 . . .

### Student's own work

###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration" target="_blank">Assessment Declaration</a> (opens in a new tab).

The *Publication manual of the American Psychological Association* does not provide information on how to cite your own work. The following is based on how to cite dissertations and theses.

If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.

#### Paraphrasing in-text

When paraphrasing, include your family name and year of previous work in brackets. Or, if referring to your family name in the body of the text, then just include the year of previous work in brackets immediately after your family name.

For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:

> Studies indicate that . . . (Smith, 2018).

> Smith (2018) noted that . . .

If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it may look like this:

> According to Smith (2018), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (2009) . . .

#### Direct quote in-text

Place direct quotes between double quotation marks " " and provide the page number from the previous work.

> "Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders" (Smith, 2018, p. 3).

#### Reference list

In the Reference list include:

- Student name

- Year of previous work

- Title of previous work (italicised)

- Unpublished paper (in square brackets)

- Institution name
