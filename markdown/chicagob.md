**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm referencing requirements with your lecturer.

- Use The Chicago Manual of Style. 17th ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017 to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on This guide is based on the Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition <a href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9921991311601341" target="_blank">The Chicago manual of style. 17th edition.</a> (opens in a new tab).

- Additional information on Chicago referencing for students can be found within: A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations : Chicago Style for Students and Researchers 9th. edition

The University of Chicago has developed several editions of the Chicago Manual of Style to aid authors in the preparation of manuscripts, which include referencing styles.

There are two systems outlined by the Chicago referencing style: **Author-Date** (Chicago B) and **Notes-Bibliography** (Chicago A).

This guide use examples in the **author-date** system. The author-date system requires in-text citations within the assignment, along with a full bibliographic entry in the reference list at the end of the assignment.

For examples and advice regarding **Notes-Bibliography** of Chicago, please see [RMIT Easy Cite referencing tool - Chicago A: Notes and Bibliography 17th ed.](index.php?styleguide=styleguide-4#stn-0).

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- Use in-text citations to acknowledge each author or source of information used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.

- Paraphrasing is the expression of the ideas of others by rephrasing the original text in your own words. For further information on paraphrasing please see <a href="https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/paraphrasing" target="_blank">Learning lab: Guide to paraphrasing</a> (opens in a new tab)

- Direct quoting involves using the exact wording used by the original author(s) in your work; this is indicated by quotation marks. For further information on direct quoting please see <a href="https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/inserting-references" target="_blank">Learning Lab: Guide to inserting references</a> (opens in a new tab)

- For specific advice on each reference you must determine the type of resource ie. book, journal article etc. and follow the recommended advice within this guide.

- In the Chicago Author Date style, in-text paraphrased citations are entered in two ways:
    - 'Information prominent' (the author's name is within the parentheses)
    - 'Author prominent' (the author's name is outside the parentheses)


> The conclusion reached in a recent study.. (Cochrane 2021)

> Cochrane (2021) concluded...

- In the Chicago Author Date style, to add a direct quote in your work, copy the exact words from the original source. Use quotation marks " " at the beginning and end of the original source. Cite the author year and page number information.

> Reflective writing in a learning journal can increase metacognition by "assisting students to develop greater self-awareness in terms of time management and learning style" (Lorenzi 2021, 3).

- When no author is available, in the text, a short version of the title (up to four words) may be used.

- When the publication date of a book or other work cannot be determined, the abbreviation n.d. takes the place of the year in the reference list entry and in-text citations. In-text, n.d. (no date) remains lowercased to avoid combining with the author’s name. e.g. (Smith n.d.) or Smith (n.d.) notes that … or (Smith n.d., 5)

- Use a page number for direct quotes. You don’t need a page number when paraphrasing.

- Page number(s) must be cited when using a direct quote. Add a comma then the page number(s). Example: (White 2011, 43).

- Paraphrased in-text citations from a chapter or other part of an edited book, include the chapter author(s) and year (Baldwin 2021).

- In-text direct quote citations, from a chapter or other part of an edited book, include the chapter author(s), year and specific chapter page. Example: (Baldwin 2021, 46).

- For references with multiple authors see Multiple Authors section of this Chicago Easy Cite guide.

- When editors, translators, or compilers are used as the author, do not include their role (trans., ed., comp.) in the in-text citation.

- When the reference list has works by authors with same last name, include their first initial in the in-text citation. Example: (A. Nelson 2015) (B. Nelson 2013).

- If an author has published multiple works in the same year, alphabetise the titles in the reference list and then add a, b, c, etc. to the year. (Example: Dickens 2008a) (Dickens 2008b).

- To cite more than one reference in a single in-text citation, separate the citations by semicolons. Example: (Dickens 2008; Lee 1998) If the works are by the same author, use just the year and separate with a comma.

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

Use a reference list to include all of the publications you have cited at the end of your work, and use the heading **References** or **Reference List** on a new page.

- All sources appearing in the reference list must be ordered **alphabetically by surname** of the first author, or title if no author is identified.

- The name of the first author is inverted (i.e., Charles Dickens to Dickens, Charles); subsequent author’s names are given in the form in which they appear in the original source publication.

- When the publication date of a book or other work cannot be determined, the abbreviation n.d. takes the place of the year in the reference list entry.

- The reference list should be **double spaced** and **hanging indents** used for each entry. A hanging indent is where the first line starts at the left margin and subsequent lines are indented about 5 spaces. There are no line spaces between references.

- The elements in the reference are separated by full stops and not commas.

- *Italics* is the preferred format for titles of books, journals and videos. Article and chapter titles are put in double quotation marks.

- **Capitalisation** within the Chicago style requires all major words to be first letter uppercase (headline case).

- For articles consulted online, include a URL or the name of the database in the reference list entry. Many journal articles list a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). A DOI forms a permanent URL that begins https<nolink>://doi.org/. This URL is preferable to the URL that appears in your browser’s address bar.

- If the article/ebook/online source can only be accessed with an account login, provide the web address of the publisher's homepage or provide the database name.

- If there are four or more authors, you may list up to ten in the reference list. For more than ten authors, list the first seven in the reference list, followed by et al. See further advice on multiple authors in the Multiple Author section of this guide.

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item

### General rules for multiple authors

###### start-subtype-content

#### Two to three authors

##### In-Text Citation

List up to three authors in both the citation and the reference list. For four or more authors, list only the first followed by et al. in the citation and all in the reference list (see four or more authors below).

If directly quoting from a source without a page number, use a paragraph number instead.

**Use a page number for direct quotes. You don’t need a page number or paragraph number when paraphrasing.**

For two authors, include First Author’s Family Name and Second Author’s Family, Year of Publication, Page or Pages.

(Author's Family Name and second Author's Family Name Year of publication, page number)

> Lai and Bakshi (2021, para. 2) state that “subcultures have been allowed to flourish online.”

For three authors, separate the first two author family names by a comma, then include ‘and’ last family name, followed by year and page number.

(Author Family Name, Author Family Name, and Author Family Name year, page).

> Megginson, Byrd, and Megginson (2000, 35) assert that "market research…

##### Reference List

Abbreviations for editor (ed.) or translator (trans.) are not included in in-text citations but are included in the reference list.

List authors in the order in which they appear in the source. The first-listed name is inverted - Family Name, Given Name. The rest of the names are written as - Given Name Family Name.

For two authors: Family Name, Given Name, and Given Name Family Name. Year etc.

### One source quoted or paraphrased in another (secondary citation)

###### start-subtype-content

Use a secondary citation to acknowledge the work of an author(s) that has been directly quoted or paraphrased in another author(s) work.

According to the Chicago Manual of Style, consulting and referencing primary sources is always preferable. However if the primary source is only available in a secondary source, then introduce the primary source in the text and note that the source is "quoted in" or "cited in" the secondary source in the citation.

#### In-Text Citation: Direct Quote

- Remember to include both sources.

If you wish to use a quote by Zukofsky, reproduced in an article by Costello, in your assignment:

You would acknowledge Zukofsky in the text and add the secondary citation (quoted in Author Family Name Year, Page number):

> In Louis Zukofsky's "Sincerity and Objectification," from the February issue of Poetry magazine, he states that Marianne Moore’s work “is largely a portrait of the author’s character intent upon the presentation which is sincerity, rather than the revealed rest of objectification...”(quoted in Costello 1981, 78).

#### In-Text Citation: Paraphrase

- Remember to include both sources.

If you read an article by Barbraud, in which he cites information from a previous study by Jones, and you wish to refer to this information in your assignment:

You would acknowledge Jones in the text and add the secondary citation (cited in Author Family Name Year):

> Jones' 2019 study, published in volume 42 of Polar Biology (cited in Barbraud 2021), found that the giant petrel sea bird is common in Antarctic waters...

#### Reference list

- According to the Chicago Manual of Style 17th ed. section 15.56 : cite only the secondary source in the reference list entry.

Follow the reference list rules for the type of resource you are citing ie. book, journal etc.

Newspaper titles are italicised.

Omit the initial *The* for English language newspaper titles. For example, (*Guardian* 2022).

If a newspaper article has no author listed, the title of the newspaper stands in place of the author and is italicised, followed by the year of publication. For example, (*New York Times* 2012).

- Chicago requires an access date in citations of websites and other sources consulted online only if no date of publication or revision can be determined from the source (see 14.12 of the Chicago Manual). In those cases that is, when only an access date is used record n.d. as the date of publication in the reference list entry and for the in-text citation. To avoid conflation with the name of the author, n.d. is always lowercase.

- Websites are created by individuals, companies, governments and other organisations. If no individual author is identified, use the organisation name as the author. If no organisation is identified either, use the webpage title in the place of the author name.

#### In-Text Citation: Direct quote

- If directly quoting from a source without a page number, use a paragraph number or section heading instead.

An author can be a person, a group of persons (a committee or named individuals), a government department or a government agency.

Government departments and agencies may be cited in-text using their acronym; in which case the matching reference list entry must also use the acronym in place of the organisation-as-author, followed by the full name in brackets; the reference list entry must be alphabetised using the abbreviation (rather than the spelled-out name), as in the ARC example.

However, where an organisation is commonly known by its acronym (such as CSIRO, Qantas, NASA), list the acronym in the reference list without the full name in brackets, as in the CSIRO example.

The publisher and author should be recorded as they appeared when the document was originally published. Do not alter the name of the government department or agency if they have changed since it was published.

### General Rules for Images

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

Chicago style uses the terminology 'illustrations' or 'figures' when including visual images presented separately from text sources.

'Figures' includes the following image types:

- Charts or Graphs

- Paintings, drawings, photographs, or other art works

When including reproduced images of diagrams, graphs, maps, photographs within your work, a caption provides a description or an explanation of the contents of the illustration. Captions are usually positioned below the illustration and include a figure number. See Captions section of this guide for further information.

When referring to an image in the text of your assignment, give a short citation consisting of the name of the artist/creator/author and the date.

Citations are also influenced by the location of where you found the image or creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than a reproduction.

Visual images from books, articles, and other sources that you refer to but do not reproduce should be cited in the standard format of the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

Visual materials that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

If you refer to any visual material, i.e. art, design or architecture, you have seen in person and you are not including an image of it in your document, provide a detailed in-text citation ie.(Georgia O'Keeffe, The Cliff Chimneys, 1938, Milwaukee Art Museum, Wisconsin)

### Captions/Figures

###### start-subtype-content

- When including diagrams, graphs, maps, photographs, etc. within your assignment, a caption provides a description or an explanation of the contents of the visual image. Captions provide a description of the visual images in your work.

- A figure number is used in the caption to identify each visual work. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear.

- Number figures consecutively in italics throughout your work using Arabic numerals, 1, 2, 3 and so on, taking care to order them as they appear within the text.

- The first figure is labelled Figure 1, the second, Figure 2, the third, Figure 3 and so on.

#### Captions for Artworks/Images

### Tables and Graphs

###### start-subtype-content

#### Reproducing a table

- When referencing a table from a book, an article or other sources, provide the page number where the table is located in text citation.

- Assign a table number, title and description to each table you place in your document. The table number, title and description go above the table ie. Table 1, 2, 3 etc.

- Acknowledge the original citation directly underneath the table.

Begin with the word 'Source: ' or Sources:', in italics, followed by a colon, then followed by:

- 'Reprinted from' if you copy the table exactly as found in the original source; or

- 'Adapted from' if you have adapted or changed the table from the original source; or

- 'Data from' if you have used the data from another source in your own table.

- If you are writing for a journal, conference paper, thesis, website, etc. you must obtain written permission from the copyright owner to reuse the table in your work, and state the permission in the source note as: Source: Reprinted with permission from ...

- Tables should be referred to in the text of your assignment by the table number you have used in your assignment so that your reader understands why you have included them.

Example - Adapting a table from a published journal article:

> Table 1: Data for end of life nursing care
>

#### AI-generated text

##### Using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and research, including assessment tasks

The educators within your courses can tell you if you are able to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including how you can use the tools and what tools you can use. If you use any AI tools, you must appropriately acknowledge and reference the use of these tools and their outputs. Failure to reference the use of these tools can result in academic misconduct.

**Please confirm with your course educator**  before using any AI tools in your assessment tasks.

**Please note**  that the guidelines on how to reference AI tools have been updated on Monday the 26th of June 2023. This is in response to updated guidelines from the APA style manual editors, as well as the new ability to generate shareable URLs in some of the AI tools.

#### Overview of text-generating AI tools

##### Introduction to AI tools that can generate text

AI tools that generate text, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are large language models with a conversational type of interface, where you can ask a question, receive a detailed response and follow up with additional queries.

Some generative AI tools are not connected to the internet and are trained on data sets up to a specific time point. Other generative AI tools connect to the internet and will provide URL links to information. There are some points to consider when using the text generated by these tools:

-   As these tools function in a similar way to predictive text on your phone, by recognising and reproducing patterns in language, they can generate incorrect information.
-   While they can produce citations and references, these are not always correct. If you are relying on the information to be accurate, you should check that the reference cited by the AI tool exists, and that the information cited is present in the original source.
-   The data sets used to train these tools often include biased and inaccurate information, as access to scholarly information and valid scientific studies may be limited, and information from social media and other less reputable sources is included.

The  [Learning Lab Artificial Intelligence Tools module](https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/artificial-intelligence-tools)  has more information on how these AI tools work, and some points to consider when using them.

##### Copyright and non-human authors

Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors and creators. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective an AI tool cannot be  [recognised as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of the work. This has informed our referencing guidance.

##### General acknowledgement that AI tools have been used in the creation of a work

In some assessment tasks, you may be able to use AI tools for background research, or to generate an outline for your essay or report (as stated earlier, please follow your educator's guidance before using any AI tools).. In this case, rather than citing and referencing specific text generated by AI tools, you will need to provide a general acknowledgement within the body or methods section of your text to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of your work. Include as much detail as possible, including how you used the AI tool, the prompt used, the date you used the tool, and the name, creator and version of the AI tool.

Example: On the 26th June 2023, I used the May 24 version of OpenAI's ChatGPT to perform background research by using the following prompt "explain the difference between deep learning and machine learning".

##### Referencing specific text content generated by AI tools

Each of the referencing styles used at RMIT is based on a source style manual. More information on the source style manuals used for each style can be found in  [Easy Cite](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/). Currently, only the editors of the APA style manual have provided advice on referencing AI-generated content. For the other referencing styles used at RMIT, we have created interim guidelines for referencing AI-generated content that we believe are the best match within that style. These may change in the future as the source style manuals develop or update their guidelines for referencing AI-generated content.

If you are referring to content generated by AI tools within your work, we recommend that you include the shareable link to the content if available, or otherwise include this AI-generated content as an appendix or supplemental information. It is also good practice to include the question or prompt that generated the response to provide context for your readers.

Two sets of reference guidelines are provided below for each style - one is for AI tools that include shareable URLs to the outputs generated from text prompts, which enables your readers to access the outputs themselves. The other is for AI tools that do not provide shareable links, meaning that the readers of your work cannot access the same information themselves.

#### AI-generated images

##### Using generative AI in learning and research, including assessment tasks

Your course lecturer can tell you if you are able to use content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including AI-generated images.  **Please confirm with your course lecturer**  for a specific assessment task before using any AI tools.

If you are able to use AI tools in your assessment task, you need to appropriately acknowledge and reference all of the AI-generated content that you include. Failure to reference this AI-generated content can result in  [academic misconduct](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/academic-integrity).

**Please note**  that the information about using generative AI tools will continue to be updated - we recommend checking this guide regularly and confirming with your course lecturer if you are unsure.

##### Overview of images generated by AI tools

Some generative AI tools have been trained on large numbers of existing images, and these tools can create new images based on prompts from users. The images created using these tools can be downloaded, but they are not published or reproducible in the AI platform. Images generated using AI tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2 are the topic of much debate. Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective there is currently no obligation to  [recognise AI as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that AI was used in the creation of the work.

AI-generated images are an emerging technology, and there are not yet clear guidelines for how to incorporate them into existing referencing styles such as APA 7th, Chicago, etc. Our current recommendation for how to reference AI-generated images varies for each referencing style, and is included below. Additionally, we recommend that you include the question or prompt that generated the image where possible, to provide context for your readers.

**Please note**  that our recommendations for how to reference AI-generated content may change in the future as referencing style manuals are updated.

### Referencing guidelines for AI-generated content

###### start-subtype-content

The Chicago Manual of Style editors have released a [Q&A post on referencing AI-generated text](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html). We have adapted these guidelines to accommodate the current Australian copyright advice that AI tools cannot be listed as authors. Instead, use the creator of the tool as the author in the in-text citation and provide bibliographic details in a reference list entry.

If a shareable URL to the content is available, include it in your reference list entry. If the content is not shareable, include the prompt used and the generated text in an appendix, and refer to the appendix in the reference list entry.


**Chicago B (author-date) style** uses an author-date format for in-text citations and a corresponding reference list.


#### In-text citation - narrative (author-prominent):

##### Rule 

> Author (year)

##### Examples

> OpenAI (2023)

> Google (2023)

 

#### In-text citation - parenthetical (information-prominent):

##### Rule

> (Author year)

##### Examples

> (OpenAI 2023)

> (Google 2023)

 

#### Reference list entry - shareable URL generated by the AI tool:

##### Rule

> {.hanging-indent}Author. Year. Name of tool. Version (if available). Month Day, Year. URL{/.hanging-indent}

##### Example

> {.hanging-indent}OpenAI. 2023. ChatGPT. May 24 version.  June 26, 2023. https<nolink>://chat.openai.com/share/81f2e81f-f137-41b6-9881-39af1672ae3c {/.hanging-indent}

#### Reference list entry - non-shareable AI-generated content:

##### Rule

> {.hanging-indent}Author. Year. *Name of tool*. Version (if available). Month Day, Year. Appendix.{/.hanging-indent}

##### Example

> {.hanging-indent}Google. 2023. *Bard*. 2023.06.07. June 26, 2023. See Appendix for generated text and prompt used.{/.hanging-indent}
