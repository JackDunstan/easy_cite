###### start-subtype-content

The Vancouver referencing style is often used in medicine, biomedical science and health sciences. This Vancouver guide is based on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/">Citing Medicine, 2nd edition: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers</a>. 

The Vancouver style is a **numerical** or **numbered** system. It requires that sources are acknowledged as an in-text citation by **numbering** them **consecutively** in the order in which they **first appear** in the body of work. For example, the first source is given number 1, the second source number 2, and so on. Each source is allocated a unique number. Once you give a source a number, the same number is used for the in-text citation whenever you refer to that source in the body of work. In the reference list at the end of your document, the source’s number appears in **numerical** order. 

**Important:** this is a guide only. To avoid losing marks, confirm referencing requirements with your educators.

### General rules for in-text citations

###### start-subtype-content

- References are numbered consecutively in the order in which they first appear in the text. For example, the first source is given the number 1, the second source 2, and so on.

- Once you have given a source a number, use the same number whenever you refer to that source in the text.

- Identifying numbers are placed outside the sentence punctuation. In the text, the number appears in parentheses (either round or square) or as superscript. Be consistent: choose one way to format the numbers and use it throughout your document. Examples:

> The theory was first put forward in 1987. (1)

> The theory was first put forward in 1987. [1]

> The theory was first put forward in 1987.<sup>1</sup>

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas or research and express them in your own words. The way you cite the information depends on the emphasis you wish to apply.

**Information-prominent citations** emphasise the information you have paraphrased or quoted:

> . . . as evidenced from a recent Australian study. (1)

**Author-prominent citations** emphasise the author: 

> In his research, Jones (2) asserts that . . .

#### Direct quotes

Direct quotes are rarely used in the Vancouver style. However, if you use the exact wording of a source:

- Use quotation marks around short direct quotes (fewer than four lines in length) 
  
- Include the page number in the in-text citation

**Note**: Within the parentheses, the in-text number is followed by a space, then the lower case letter 'p' with no space before the page number.

> "The increasing availability and growth rate of biomedical information, also known as ‘big data’, provides an opportunity for future personalized medicine programs that will significantly improve patient care". (1 p433)

Quotes longer than four lines should be **indented** in a block, in **reduced type** and **without quotation marks**:

> With the increased need to store data and information generated by big projects, computational solutions, such as cloud-based computing, have emerged. Cloud computing is the only storage model that can provide the elastic scale needed for DNA sequencing, whose rate of technology advancement could now exceed Moore's Law. Moore's law is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors on integrated circuits and the speed of computers double approximately every 2 years. (1 p433)

### Citing multiple references at the same point in-text

###### start-subtype-content

When citing more than one reference at the same point in your text, give the relevant numbers, separated by commas. Include one space between the comma and the next number:

> A number of researchers (4, 5) discovered that . . .

> A number of researchers (3, 6, 10) discovered that . . .

If the references have **consecutive numbers**, use a hyphen between numbers. There should be no space between numbers and hyphens:

> A number of researchers (4-7) discovered that . . .

### Secondary citations

###### start-subtype-content

A secondary citation is used when you acknowledge the work of an author that you have read about in a different author’s work.

It is always preferable to read and reference the original source if it is available. When that is not possible, ask your educator if a secondary citation is acceptable.

Secondary citation does not appear in <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/citingmedicine">*Citing medicine: the NLM style guide for authors, editors, and publishers* (2nd ed.)</a> or <a href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/tcai14/alma9921837011901341">*The AMA manual of style: a guide for authors and editors* (11th ed.)</a> upon which the Vancouver style is based. The recommendation below is from <a href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/tcai14/alma9910090260001341">*The AMA manual of style: a guide for authors and editors* (10th ed.)</a> .

The Vancouver style requires you to distinguish between **citation** (works mentioned or paraphrased) and **quotation** (works quoted) by the subsequent author.

#### Cited by

If you read an article written by Acheson and they **cite** (that is, mention or paraphrase) information from another study written by Cauley et al., you need to acknowledge Cauley et al. in your text:

> Cauley et al. (1), as cited by Acheson, concluded that risk of fractures is...

In your reference list, you need to reference Cauley et al. **cited by** Acheson.

> 1. Cauley JA, Lui L-Y, Ensrud KE, et al. Osteoporosis and fracture risk in women of different ethnic groups. JAMA. 2005;293(17):2102-2108. Cited by: Acheson LS. Bone density and the risk of fractures: should treatment thresholds vary by race [editorial]? JAMA. 2005;293(17):2151-2154.

#### Quoted by

If you read an article written by Prazar that **directly quotes** information from another study written by Kato et al., you need to acknowledge Kato et al. in your text:

> Prazar quotes Kato et al. (2) to explain new treatments in...

In your reference list, you need to reference Kato et al. **quoted by** Prazar.

> 2. Kato S, Sherman PM. What is new related to Helicobacter pylori infection in children and teenagers? Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2005;159(5):415-421. Quoted by: Prazar G. How many pediatricians does it take to change a practice? or how to incorporate change in a practice [editorial]. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med.  2005;159(5):500-502.

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- Create a reference list at the end of your document, on a **new page**.

- Under the heading Reference List, list the publication details of all your in-text references. Include only those works cited in the text. 

- List references **numerically in the order they first appear in your text**, matching the numbers used in-text.

- The reference list should be single-spaced with one line space between each entry.

#### Bibliography

- Any sources that you have read but **not** paraphrased or quoted are listed separately under the heading Bibliography.

- The bibliography is arranged in **alphabetical order** by author family name or title (where no author is given), and otherwise follows the same Vancouver style as reference list entries.

#### Titles

- Do not use italics for any titles, e.g. book titles, journal titles, titles of journal articles.

- Use sentence case for minimal capitalisation. For book titles and journal article titles, capitalise the first word and proper nouns only.

- For journal titles, use the abbreviated format. To find the correct title abbreviation, go to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals/">Journals in NCBI Databases</a>  and then enter the journal’s full title to display its abbreviation.

#### Authors

For authors, begin with the family name followed by the initial(s). There are no spaces or full stops between initials (e.g. Smith AB).

Where there are six or fewer authors, list all the authors.

If there are more than six authors, list the first six followed by **et al**.

#### Place of publication

For the place of publication, add the city, and then qualify it – see below – by the US or Canada state code or country name.

- **Cities in the USA and Canada**: Include the two-letter abbreviation for the state or province, e.g. St Louis (MO); Hamilton (ON).

- **Cities in other countries**: Use the country name after all cities not in the USA or Canada, e.g. Melbourne (Australia); Oxford (United Kingdom).

- **No place of publication**: Use [place unknown] in square brackets.

> Kuttner L. A child in pain: how to help, what to do. [place unknown]: Hartley & Marks; 1996.

#### Pagination

For books in the reference list, pagination (i.e. total number of pages) is optional. *Note: The examples in this guide do not include pagination for books.*

If there is no pagination, give an indication of the length of the source in square brackets. This can be provided as print pages, screens or paragraphs e.g. [about 1 p.], [about 5 screens], [8 paragraphs]

#### Punctuation for references ending with a URL

When a URL ends with a forward slash, end the citation with a full stop.

When a URL does not end with a forward slash, do not end the citation with a full stop.

#### In-text citation: paraphrase

Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas or research and express them in your own words. Acknowledge the author by **inserting a number** after their name (if you use it) or at the end of your sentence. 

> Using a case study, Sullivan (1) demonstrates the relationship between goal setting and career advancement.

> Effective verbal and non-verbal communication skills are essential for nurses. (1)

Number each source in the order in which they **first** appear in your text. Your in-text citation will correspond to the same number in the reference list. Use the same number whenever you cite that source.

For more explanation, see **Using Vancouver: General rules for in-text citations** in this style guide.

#### In-text citation: direct quote

A direct quote is when you use someone else's exact words. Acknowledge the author in the same way as a paraphrase, with the addition of the **page number** where the author's quotation is found. Place quotation marks around the quotation to make it clear these are not your own words.

> According to Sullivan (1), nurses "get fulfillment from caring for others". (p29)

> While the public may value nurses highly, "nursing ranks low in career desirability". (1 p47)

For more explanation, see **Using Vancouver: General rules for in-text citations** in this style guide.

#### Reference list

Follow **Using Vancouver: General rules for the reference list** in this style guide to format your reference list. 

When following the example below it is important to:

- Place each element in the **same order** as the example
- Use the same **punctuation**

### Book with multiple authors

###### start-subtype-content

#### In-text citation: paraphrase

Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas or research and express them in your own words. 

When paraphrasing a book with multiple authors, insert the reference list number for that title as you would for a book with one author: 

> The use of binomial control charts (2) is recommended for...

However, if you wish to include the authors' names in your sentence, use the family name of the first author only followed by **et al.**:

> Morton et al. (2) suggest that the use of binomial control charts ...

For more explanation, see **Using Vancouver: General rules for in-text citations** in this style guide.

#### In-text citation: direct quote

A direct quote is when you use someone else's exact words. Your in-text citation must always include the page number where the author's quotation is found. 

When quoting directly from a book with more than one author, insert the reference list number for that title followed by the page number:

> Researchers are advised that "the possibility of bias should be kept in mind". (2 p132)

However, if you wish to write the authors' names in your sentence, use the family name of the first author only followed by **et al.**:

> According to Morton et al., "the possibility of bias should be kept in mind" (2 p132) when using any chart type to...

#### In-text citation: paraphrase

Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas or research and express them in your own words. Acknowledge the author by **inserting a number** after their name (if you use it) or at the end of your sentence. 

Number each source in the order in which they **first** appear in your text. Your in-text citation will correspond to the same number in the reference list. Use the same number whenever you cite that source.

For more explanation, see **Using Vancouver: General rules for in-text citations** in this style guide.

>In his research, Musiek (12) found that sleep and the circadian system ...

#### In-text citation: direct quote

A direct quote is when you use someone else's exact words. Acknowledge the author in the same way as a paraphrase, with the addition of the **page number** where the author's quotation is found. Place quotation marks around the quotation to make it clear these are not your own words.

> Whilst there has been widespread description of circadian rhythm abnormalities in individuals with symptoms of AD dementia, there are "discrepancies regarding rhythms in temperature and cortisol secretion." (12 p87)

For more explanation, see **Using Vancouver: General rules for in-text citations** in this style guide.

#### Reference list

Follow **Using Vancouver: General rules for the reference list** in this style guide to format your reference list. 

When following the example below it is important to:

- Place each element in the **same order** as the example
- Use the same **punctuation**
- Do **not** use italics
- Use **sentence case** for titles: capitalise the first word and proper nouns only.
- **Journals titles** must be abbreviated.
- **Page numbers** are not repeated (that is, 17-8 not 17-18) unless followed by a letter (eg. 145A-149A).

### General rules for referencing images

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

#### General rules

In the Vancouver style, the term “illustration” applies to anything that is not written. For example:

- images (labelled as "Figures" when included in-text)

- tables

- charts

- graphs

The following are general rules for citing illustrations – whatever the type - using the Vancouver referencing style. However, the specific examples provided in this Vancouver guide are for citing images.

#### Using numbers

The Vancouver referencing style uses Arabic numerals, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc., whenever a number is required. Do not use:

- Roman numerals, e.g. i, ii, iii

- words, e.g. one, two, three

#### In-text citations

Below the illustration you have inserted in your text, add a caption that includes:

- a label and number. The number will depend on where it appears in your text. E.g. If it is the first figure in your text, it will be labelled Figure 1.

- the description or title used in the original source

- a reference number in parentheses. This is the number that you give it according to where it appears in your text. For example, if it is the 12th source cited in your document, the reference number will be (12).

#### The reference list

In the reference list, include the sources of all the illustrations that you have used from another source and inserted in your text.

In general, this is the order that the references in your list will include:

- the reference number you gave a reference in-text

- the standard reference structure for the particular reference type source (e.g. a book)

- the figure number that was used in that original source

- the title of the illustration

- the page number where the illustration is located in the source (if available or applicable)

#### Images not numbered in the original source, e.g. image on a webpage or in a database

- If the illustration is not numbered, give it a number according to its placement on the webpage and enclose it in square brackets. For example, if it is the first illustration in the original source, give it the number 1, e.g. [Figure 1].

- If it is the only illustration given in the original source, just use [Figure].

- the standard reference structure for a book

- the figure number that was used in that original source (e.g. in the book example, it was Figure 4.25).

- title of the illustration

- the page number on which the figure is located in the book

### Student's own work

###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment Declaration</a> (opens in a new tab).

The publication <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/">Citing Medicine</a> (opens in a new tab) on which this information is based does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following is based on how to cite dissertations and theses.

If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.

#### Paraphrasing in-text

For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:

> Studies indicate that … (24).

> Smith (24) noted that …

If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it may look like this:

> According to Smith (24), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (18) …

#### Direct quote in-text

Place direct quotes between double quotation marks " " and provide the page number from the previous work.

> "Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders". (24 p3).

#### Reference List

In the Reference list include:

- Student name

- Title of previous work

- Unpublished paper (in square brackets)

- City and Country (in square brackets)

- Institution name

- Year of previous work

- Total number of pages of previous work

#### AI-generated text

##### Using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and research, including assessment tasks
The educators within your courses can tell you if you are able to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including how you can use the tools and what tools you can use. If you use any AI tools, you must appropriately acknowledge and reference the use of these tools and their outputs. Failure to reference the use of these tools can result in academic misconduct. 

**Please confirm with your course educator** before using any AI tools in your assessment tasks. 

**Please note** that the guidelines on how to reference AI tools have been updated on Monday the 26th of June 2023. This is in response to updated guidelines from the APA style manual editors, as well as the new ability to generate shareable URLs in some of the AI tools.

##### Overview of text-generating AI tools

**Introduction to AI tools that can generate text**

AI tools that generate text, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are large language models with a conversational type of interface, where you can ask a question, receive a detailed response and follow up with additional queries. 

Some generative AI tools are not connected to the internet and are trained on data sets up to a specific time point. Other generative AI tools connect to the internet and will provide URL links to information. There are some points to consider when using the text generated by these tools: 

- As these tools function in a similar way to predictive text on your phone, by recognising and reproducing patterns in language, they can generate incorrect information.
- While they can produce citations and references, these are not always correct. If you are relying on the information to be accurate, you should check that the reference cited by the AI tool exists, and that the information cited is present in the original source.
- The data sets used to train these tools often include biased and inaccurate information, as access to scholarly information and valid scientific studies may be limited, and information from social media and other less reputable sources is included.

The [Learning Lab Artificial Intelligence Tools module](https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/artificial-intelligence-tools) has more information on how these AI tools work, and some points to consider when using them. 

**Copyright and non-human authors**

Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors and creators. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective an AI tool cannot be [recognised as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of the work. This has informed our referencing guidance.

**General acknowledgement that AI tools have been used in the creation of a work**

In some assessment tasks, you may be able to use AI tools for background research, or to generate an outline for your essay or report (as stated earlier, please follow your educator's guidance before using any AI tools).. In this case, rather than citing and referencing specific text generated by AI tools, you will need to provide a general acknowledgement within the body or methods section of your text to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of your work. Include as much detail as possible, including how you used the AI tool, the prompt used, the date you used the tool, and the name, creator and version of the AI tool.  

Example: On the 26th June 2023, I used the May 24 version of OpenAI's ChatGPT to perform background research by using the following prompt "explain the difference between deep learning and machine learning". 

**Referencing specific text content generated by AI tools**

Each of the referencing styles used at RMIT is based on a source style manual. More information on the source style manuals used for each style can be found in [Easy Cite](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/). Currently, only the editors of the APA  style manual have provided advice on referencing AI-generated content. For the other referencing styles used at RMIT, we have created interim guidelines for referencing AI-generated content that we believe are the best match within that style. These may change in the future as the source style manuals develop or update their guidelines for referencing AI-generated content.  

If you are referring to content generated by AI tools within your work, we recommend that you include the shareable link to the content if available, or otherwise include this AI-generated content as an appendix or supplemental information. It is also good practice to include the question or prompt that generated the response to provide context for your readers. 

Two sets of reference guidelines are provided below for each style - one is for AI tools that include shareable URLs to the outputs generated from text prompts, which enables your readers to access the outputs themselves.  The other is for AI tools that do not provide shareable links, meaning that the readers of your work cannot access the same information themselves. 


#### AI-generated images

##### Using generative AI in learning and research, including assessment tasks
Your course lecturer can tell you if you are able to use content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including AI-generated images. **Please confirm with your course lecturer** for a specific assessment task before using any AI tools.

If you are able to use AI tools in your assessment task, you need to appropriately acknowledge and reference all of the AI-generated content that you include. Failure to reference this AI-generated content can result in [academic misconduct](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/academic-integrity).

**Please note** that the information about using generative AI tools will continue to be updated - we recommend checking this guide regularly and confirming with your course lecturer if you are unsure.

##### Overview of images generated by AI tools

Some generative AI tools have been trained on large numbers of existing images, and these tools can create new images based on prompts from users. The images created using these tools can be downloaded, but they are not published or reproducible in the AI platform. Images generated using AI tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2 are the topic of much debate.  Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective there is currently no obligation to [recognise AI as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that AI was used in the creation of the work.  

AI-generated images are an emerging technology, and there are not yet clear guidelines for how to incorporate them into existing referencing styles such as APA 7th, Chicago, etc. Our current recommendation for how to reference AI-generated images varies for each referencing style, and is included below. Additionally, we recommend that you include the question or prompt that generated the image where possible, to provide context for your readers. 

**Please note** that our recommendations for how to reference AI-generated content may change in the future as referencing style manuals are updated.

#### Vancouver Interim guidelines

The RMIT Vancouver guide is based on the e-book Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers [Internet]. 2nd edition. The NLM Style Guide does not currently contain any guidelines for referencing AI-generated content, however the International Community of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) has released [guidance on the use of generative AI tools in scholarly work published in medical journals](https://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf). The advice is that generative AI tools should not be listed or cited as authors, and that the use of AI tools must be acknowledged.

The NLM style guide includes guidelines for referencing a number of internet source types. We have adapted these guidelines below, as we believe this is the best match for the style.  Please note these are interim guidelines and these may be updated in the future when the NLM style manual editors release formal advice.

Use the name of the creator of the tool as the author. If a shareable URL to the content is available, include it in your reference list entry.  If the content is not shareable, include the prompt used and the output generated in an appendix. Include the general URL for the tool and a note about the appendix in the reference list entry.

The Vancouver style uses numbered in-text citations that match the corresponding footnote or endnote entry. 

##### Reference list entry example - shareable URL generated by the AI tool:

Rule: Reference number. Name of AI tool [Type of medium]. Creator of tool; Date of version YYYY Mon [cited YYYY Mon DD]. Available from URL 

Example: 1. ChatGPT [Internet]. OpenAI; 2023 May [cited 2023 Jun 26]. Available from https<nolink>://chat.openai.com/share/81f2e81f-f137-41b6-9881-39af1672ae3c

##### Reference list entry example - non-shareable AI-generated content:

Rule: Reference number. Name of AI tool [Type of medium]. Creator of tool; Date of version YYYY Mon [cited YYYY Mon DD]. Available from URL. Appendix.

Example: 1. Claude [Internet]. Anthropic [cited 2024 Jan 22]. Available from https<nolink>://claude.ai/chats. See Appendix for text generated and prompt used.

#### How to reference AI-generated images in Vancouver
The RMIT Vancouver guide contains general information on [using and referencing images](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/?styleguide=styleguide-7#stn-4).

##### How to reference images that you produce using an AI tool:

Include the image in your work with a caption that explains that the work was generated using an AI tool, and what prompt was used.

Example:

![Sunset over the ocean on a stormy day](images/Firefly-sunset-over-the-ocean-on-a-stormy-day-16158.jpg)<br>

Figure 1. Image generated using Adobe Firefly from the prompt sunset over the ocean on a stormy day.

##### How to reference AI-generated images reproduced in a published source:

If using reproduced images, reference the published source, using a numbered in-text citation that matches the corresponding reference list entry. In a caption below the image include the same description as in the published source, as well as a reference number.

**Caption**

Rule: Figure number. The description of figure from the published source (reference number)

Example: Figure 1. Jason Allen’s A.I.-generated work, “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,” took first place in the digital category at the Colorado State Fair (1)

**Reference list entry:**

Reference the published source according to the relevant source guidelines, and then add the figure number used in the published source (or a number according to its placement on the page in square brackets if not numbered), the title of the figure in the published source, and the page number or location where the figure is located in the published source (if applicable).

Example: 1. Roose K. An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy. The New York Times [Internet]. 2022 Sep 2. [cited 2023 Mar 3]; [about 9 screens]. Available from https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html. [Figure 1], Jason Allen’s A.I.-generated work, “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial,” took first place in the digital category at the Colorado State Fair.
