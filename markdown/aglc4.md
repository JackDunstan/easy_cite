**Important: This is a guide only**. To avoid losing marks:

-	Confirm referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer.

-	The Australian Guide to Legal Citation (AGLC) 4th ed, 2018 is a required referencing style for students enrolled in the Juris Doctor program at RMIT University.

-	Use <a href="https://www.mulr.com.au/aglc/AGLC4-2021-v1.pdf" target="_blank">*Australian Guide to Legal Citation* (4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2018)</a> (opens in a new tab), published by Melbourne University Law Review Association Inc. to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.

### General principles

###### start-subtype-content

The AGLC4 style consists of:

-	Footnotes to provide information about sources used in your work.

-	Within the text of your work, footnote numbers (using a superscript) are positioned after punctuation.

-	Footnotes appear at the end of each page of your work.

-	Use a full stop at the end of each footnote.

-	Separate multiple sources in a footnote with a semicolon (;).

-	A **Pinpoint** is the particular page, paragraph or chapter number from which you have sourced information.

-	The first time a source is cited, it is cited in full. Thereafter, it is appropriate to use either '**ibid**' or '**n**'. See AGLC section 1.4.

-	If a bibliography is required it should be provided at the end of the paper. Give details of each source mentioned in the text, as well as details of other sources consulted in preparing the paper.

**In-text example**

>  Recent developments in Australian law following the decision of the High Court in *IceTV Pty Ltd v Network Nine Australia Pty Ltd* illustrate a fundamental shift in the approach of courts regarding the importance and form of authorship.<sup>1</sup>

**Footnote example**

>  <sup>1</sup> *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14.

#### Pinpoint references

A pinpoint reference within a footnote directs the reader to a particular place in the cited work:

-	For sources such as cases, books or journal articles, a pinpoint reference might refer the reader to a particular chapter, page or paragraph.

-	For legislative materials, pinpoint references can also refer to parts, sections, clauses or divisions.

-	A pinpoint reference is provided at the end of the footnote.

See section 3.1.4 of the <a href="https://www.mulr.com.au/aglc/AGLC4-2021-v1.pdf" target="_blank">AGLC4</a> (opens in a new tab)  for a full list of abbreviations used in pinpoint references for legislative materials.

#### Repeat citations

When a source is cited more than once in a paper the full bibliographic details should only be provided in the first instance.

The terms '**Ibid**' and '**n**' are used for repeat citations of the same work. In some circumstances, '**above (n)**' or '**below (n)**' are used to direct the reader to a specific part or reference within a text.

**Using 'Ibid'**

Use 'Ibid' in a footnote where the immediately preceding footnote refers to the same work. The exception to this rule is if a footnote lists more than one source (in this case use 'n').
If a footnote refers to the same work and to the same pinpoint reference, simply use 'Ibid'. The pinpoint reference does not need to be repeated in this case.
If a footnote refers to the same work but to a different pinpoint reference, use 'Ibid' followed by the pinpoint reference.

> <sup>1</sup> *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14.<br>
> <sup>2</sup> Ibid. <br>
> <sup>3</sup> Ibid HCA 15-16.

**Using 'n'**

Use ‘n’ to refer to a source that has been cited in a previous footnote other than the immediately preceding one.

If citing a source that has already been referred to then a shortened form of the citation should be provided (e.g. shortened author name or title), along with the footnote number **(n)** in parentheses. Also include the pinpoint if different from the first citation.

> <sup>1</sup> *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd* [2009] HCA 14.<br>
> ...<br>
> <sup>4</sup> *IceTV* (n 1) HCA 17.

Note: If referring to a specific part/s or reference/s within a text then use 'above (n)' or 'below (n)' where appropriate. See AGLC section 1.4.2 for further details.

> <sup>5</sup> See above n 1 and accompanying text.<br>
> <sup>6</sup> See below n 7 Part II(A).

### General rules for the bibliography

###### start-subtype-content

If a bibliography is required list all works referred to both in footnotes and in the body of your assignment, as well as all works consulted in writing your assignment.

The bibliography is divided into sections as outlined in AGLC 1.13:

A. *Articles/Books/Reports*

B. *Cases*

C. *Legislation*

D. *Treaties*

E. *Other*

Note: Organise items alphabetically under each heading.

Note that details provided in the bibliography are almost identical to details provided in the footnotes, with the following exceptions:

-	Invert the first author’s first name and family name and separate these with a comma.

-	Pinpoint references are not included; however, note that the starting page number for journal articles and cases is **not** a pinpoint and remains part of the citation.

-	There is **no** full stop at the end of a bibliography entry.

### Student's own work

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration" target="_blank">Assessment Declaration</a> (opens in a new tab).

The publication, *Australian Guide to Legal Citation* (4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2018) does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following examples show how to cite your own work that you have previously submitted for assessment.

If you cite or quote your own previous work, treat yourself as the author and the title of your previous assessment as an unpublished paper.

Note: If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well.

Include the following details:

- Student name

- 'Title of previous work'

- Unpublished paper

- University

- Month Year

#### Footnote example

For example, if Geoffrey Smith wanted to cite a paper they wrote at RMIT University in 2019, their footnote reference may look like this:

> <sup>1</sup> Geoffrey Smith, 'Australia's copyright law reforms' (unpublished paper, RMIT University, October 2019).

#### Pinpoint example

> <sup>1</sup> Geoffrey Smith, 'Australia's copyright law reforms' (unpublished paper, RMIT University, October 2019) 5.

#### Bibliography example

> Smith, Geoffrey, 'Australia's copyright law reforms' (unpublished paper, RMIT University, October 2019)
