**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Please confirm the referencing requirements for your course with your lecturer.

- Use the <a href="https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution" target="_blank">**Referencing and attribution**</a> (opens in a new tab) section of the *Australian Government Style Manual (AGSM)* released in 2021, to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. The RMIT Harvard guide is based on this publication.

RMIT Harvard is an author-date referencing style based on the **Author-date** referencing style of the AGSM.

RMIT Harvard style requires in-text references and the reference list.

**In-text references** appear within the body of the document. They include the author’s family name or name of the organisation responsible for the information source and the year of publication, with page numbers required for quotes if available.

**A reference list** provides the full bibliographic details of all in-text references at the end of the assignment.

**Note:** Although the AGSM states that the title of online sources should be hyperlinked for electronic formats, RMIT Harvard style does not do this because hyperlinked titles are not compatible with the EndNote program. In addition, the links would not be available when the work is printed.

### General rules for in-text references

###### start-subtype-content

- Use in-text references to acknowledge each author or source of information (print or online) used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.  
    
    **Paraphrasing** is when you express the author’s ideas in your own words. Paraphrasing is generally preferred to quotes as they show you understand and can explain the ideas you have read rather than simply copying them.
    
    **A direct quote** is when you use the exact words from the original source. Use quotes sparingly, such as when the exact words of the author are important to the claim you are making. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks). Include a page number in the in-text reference if available.
    
    In-text references include the author’s family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with page numbers (if available) required for quotes.
    
- An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence. When you are referencing information that authors/researchers agree about, the reference is placed at the end of the sentence (an information prominent citation). This is the most common type of in-text reference. Referencing at the beginning of a sentence (author prominent citation) is used to focus on a particular author/researcher’s point of view or on specific research that might not apply in all situations.

- If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, the date (and page number for direct quote) is placed in parentheses immediately after the author's family name.

- When a work has two authors, always list both authors’ family names every time the reference occurs. Use the full word **and** when listing the authors in parentheses. For example: (Hill and Martinez-Diez 2020). Also use the full word **and** when mentioning the authors in a sentence. For example: Hill and Martinez-Diez (2020)... .

- When a work has three or more authors, list the first author’s family name followed by et al. For example, Haslam et al. (2021) or (Haslam et al. 2021).

- For **pen names and pseudonyms**, use the name adopted by the author, e.g. ...(Mari 2009), Quynh Huong (2020) inspires... In the reference list, list according to the pen name or pseudonym and include the author’s actual name in parentheses if known.

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.
    
- For **multiple citations in the same parentheses**, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;) for example:  
    
    > It has been claimed that ... (Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).
    
- For **multiple works by the same author in the same year**, insert a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.  
    
    > It is argued that ... (Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).
    
    > Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that...
    
- Some works have **different first authors with the same family name**. To identify their works, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.  
    
    > It is argued that ... (Peterson M 2019), but others claim that... (Peterson JR et al. 2021).
    

#### Direct quote

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s).

Do not overuse direct quotes.

Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

If you **change the wording of a quote**, follow the steps below to ensure that you do not change the meaning of the original text:

- Use an **ellipsis** which consists of three dots (...) if you leave out any part of the original text.

- If you want to add words to the original text (e.g. to integrate the grammar or make the information clearer), you must put them in **square brackets** \[ \].

With direct quotes, always use the spelling and formatting style of the original source.

If the source contains grammatical or spelling errors, you must copy the quote exactly as it appears in the original source (including the errors). Then put sic in parentheses **(sic)** immediately after the error.

A quote in an in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

> Day (2018:3) states that 'writing is a uniquely powerful, precise and satisfying form of expression. It is also a vital skill for future employment'.

##### Middle of a sentence

> In the introduction to their study of consumer purchasing preferences, Liang et al. (2021:163) observe that 'the Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart home technology, has been rapidly advancing and has finally reached mainstream markets and user segments'.

##### End of a sentence

> 'Building plans tend to ignore climate risks in most instances' (Hill and Martinez-Diez 2020:18).

#### Block quotations

Block quotations are quotes of more than 30 words.

Block quotes do not use inverted commas. They are signalled with a colon, and the quote begins on a new line that is indented from the margin and can be set in smaller text size.

As Smithers (2020:57) points out:

> Paraphrasing and synthesising information shows deeper understanding of your reading and research than simply using direct quotes. It enables you to demonstrate your insight into the concepts and thus obtain higher marks in your assignment.

#### Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

Paraphrasing in an in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.

##### Beginning of a sentence

> Fiorineschi and Rotini (2021) explain that the design discipline commonly recognises novelty as an important factor in assessing creativity.

##### Middle of a sentence

> Using daily rainfall datasets, the Bureau of Meteorology (2022) highlights...

##### End of a sentence

> The Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) program aims to develop students’ professional self and enable them to build and reinvent their practice (Papadopoulou 2020).

### Multiple works by the same author(s) in the same year

###### start-subtype-content

Identify works by the same author in the same year by inserting a letter after the year, starting with the letter ‘a’ for the first work you cite, e.g. 2021a, 2021b. In the reference list, include the same letter after each year of publication.

#### In-text reference

> It is argued that...(Ayoob 2021a, 2021b).

> Ayoob (2021a, 2021b) states that...

#### Reference list entry

> Ayoob M (2021a) *How much change will the end of the Netanyahu era bring?*, Australian Strategic Policy Institute: The Strategist website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.aspistrategist.org.au/how-much-change-will-the-end-of-the-netanyahu-era-bring/

> Ayoob M (2021b) *What will happen to the nuclear deal under Iran’s new president?*, Australian Strategic Policy Institute: The Strategist website, accessed 9 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.aspistrategist.org.au/what-will-happen-to-the-nuclear-deal-under-irans-new-president/

### Referencing works by different first authors with the same family name

###### start-subtype-content

To identify the works of different first authors with the same family name, insert the initial(s) of all the first authors’ given names in the in-text references. In the reference list, order their works by the year of publication.

#### In-text reference

> It is argued that...(Peterson M 2019), but others claim that...(Peterson JR et al. 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, order the works of each author by the year of publication. For this example, since Peterson M published their work in 2019 and Peterson JR in 2021, you need to list the Peterson M (2019) reference **before** that of Peterson JR (2021).

###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item


###### start-subtype-item

### Multiple references in the same parentheses

###### start-subtype-content

When including two or more references in the same parentheses in a sentence, list all citations chronologically, separated by a semi-colon (;).

#### In-text reference

> It has been claimed that...(Ghezzi and Cavallo 2018; Jocevski 2020; Soluk et al. 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, include the sources you referenced in the parentheses.


###### end-subtype-content

###### end-subtype-item


###### start-subtype-item

### Secondary citations

###### start-subtype-content

A **secondary citation** acknowledges the work of an author (the original source) you refer to in your writing that you have read about in someone else's work. Where possible, try to use the original source. A secondary citation should only be used if you are unable to track down and access the original source. You should also keep secondary citations to a minimum.

For example, if you use Vanna's (2019) ideas (the original source), which you read about in an article by Martin and Rodriguez (2021), you will need to show who the ideas belong to (Vanna 2019) and where you read about them (Martin and Rodriguez 2021).

#### In-text reference

> Previous research appears to indicate... (Vanna 2019, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021).

> Vanna (2019, cited in Martin and Rodriguez 2021) suggests that...

In both examples, the ideas belong to Vanna (2019), but you paraphrased them from your reading of Martin and Rodriguez's (2021) work.

#### Reference list entry

In the reference list, only include the source you read. For this example, if you use Vanna's (2019) ideas (the original source) which you read about in an article by Martin and Rodriguez (2021), in your reference list you will only need to show where you read Vanna's (2019) ideas in (Martin and Rodriguez 2021). In this case, you would only put the Martin and Rodriguez (2021) reference in the reference list, not Vanna (2019).

### General rules for the reference list

###### start-subtype-content

- Use a reference list at the end of the document to include the publication details of all the in-text references cited within your writing.

- The general order of the elements is:
    - author or authoring organisation’s name
    - publishing date
    - title information
    - publisher details
    - accessed date and URL for digital content

- Start a reference list on a new page using the heading **References**.

- List only references cited in your writing.

- If your lecturer/teacher or supervisor has also requested a bibliography, list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing under a heading of **Bibliography**.

- The reference list is arranged alphabetically by the family name of the **author**. If the author of a reference is a company or organisation, list the reference based on the first letter of the company or organisation name.

- When the shortened form or acronym of an organisation’s name is mentioned in your work, use it in your references. List the short form, then include the full name in parentheses.

- If there are **multiple entries by the same author**, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.

- If there are **multiple entries by the same author in the same year**, add ‘a’ after the first work, ‘b’ after the second and so on.

- If there are **multiple different first authors with the same family name**, then arrange alphabetically by initial(s) of the first authors' given names.

- If the author used a **pseudonym or pen name**, list that name in the author position. If the actual name is known, place it in parentheses after the pen name, e.g. Mari (Maria Giovanna Colli).

- If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.

- If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.

- If there is no place of publication, use **n.p.** (for 'no place').

- If the place of publication (city name) is not commonly known (e.g. Harlow) or the place of publication could be in two or more countries, put the country name after the city. For example, Harlow, England.

- If citing a **PDF**, link to the page where the PDF is hosted not the PDF link.

- If the publication has a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier), include it in the reference list, at the end of the citation using the short form ‘doi’ in lower case, e.g. Zufferey C, Yu N and Hand T (2020) ‘Researching home in social work’, *Qualitative Social Work*, 19(5-6):1095-1110, doi:10.1177/1473325019880244.

- If the work is in a **language other than English**, put the title in the original language followed by the English translation, e.g. *Gabrielle Chanel. Manifeste de Mode (Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion manifesto)*.

> The Lancet Rheumatology (2021) states that for people aged over 50 years, giant cell arteritis is the most common type of vasculitis, even though it is a rare illness.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- If the journal article does not have a person identified as the author, use the name of the journal instead (do no italicise) followed by the year of the article in parentheses, e.g. The Lancet Rheumatology (2021).

- If no publication year supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then write **c.** (meaning ‘circa’ or approximately) followed by the year.

- Put the title of the article in single inverted commas (quotation marks). Italicise only the second instance of the journal name after the article title.

- After the second instance of the journal name, include the volume number followed by issue number in parentheses. If no issue number is supplied, leave it out. After issue number, include a colon (:) followed by the page number range, i.e. start and end page. If page range is not available, put the start page instead.

- If available, include the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in lower case after the pagination. If no DOI is available and the work was sourced from a print (physical/hardcopy) journal, end pagination with a full stop and add no more. If the work was sourced from an online e-journal and there is no DOI, after the pagination add the accessed date and database name (if sourced from a library database) or accessed date and URL link (if sourced from a website). Please see the **e-Journal article** section below for more details and examples.

##### Rule

> Name of Journal (Year) 'Title of article: subtitle of article', *Name of Journal*, volume(issue):start page-end page, doi:number \[if available\].

##### Example

> The Lancet Rheumatology (2021) 'Giant cell arteritis: one size does not fit all', *The Lancet Rheumatology*, 3(12):E819, doi:10.1016/S2665-9913(21)00364-7.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. After the year, put a colon (:) followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The first example below comes from a source that has a page number, i.e. 163. The second example does not have page numbers:

> In the introduction to their study of consumer purchasing preferences, Liang et al. (2021:163) observe that 'the Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart home technology, has been rapidly advancing and has finally reached mainstream markets and user segments'.

> 'The association between SSB \[sugar-sweetened beverages\] consumption and both endometrial and ovarian cancer risk tended to be positive but did not reach statistically significant levels' (Llaha et al. 2021).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Liang et al. (2021) claim that consumers, due to their beliefs about connectivity efficiency with the Internet of Things, display a high level of brand loyalty when purchasing smart devices and products for the home.

> Although Llaha et al. (2021) discovered that there is a correlation between drinking sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and developing endometrial and ovarian cancer, it was minor and insignificant.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- List all authors and other bibliographic details in the same way as with other journal article examples.

- List all authors in the order in which they appear in the article. Use the initials of each author's given name(s).

- For two authors, use **and** to separate them.

- For three or more authors, use **and** to separate last two names.

- Enclose publication year in parentheses after the author. If there is no author, enclose the year in parentheses after article title.

- If no publication year supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text, then write **c.** (meaning ‘circa’ or approximately) followed by the year.

- Enclose the title of the article in single inverted commas (quotation marks) and italicise the journal title.

- After journal title, include volume number followed issue number in parentheses. If no issue number is supplied, leave it out. After issue number, include a colon (:) followed by the page number range, i.e. start and end page. If page range not available, put the start page instead.

- If available, include the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) in lower case after the pagination. If no DOI available, add the database name (if sourced from library database) or URL (if sourced from website).

- **Sourced from a website:** add the name of the website followed by the word **website**. Then put the accessed date (e.g. accessed 26 November 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

- **Sourced from a library database:** add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 26 November 2021), then a comma, a space and the database name followed by the word **database**.

### Website / webpage

<!-- first accordion item -->
###### start-subtype-content

An entire website is only cited if you are referring to its content or purpose in general, or if you cannot link the information to a particular webpage.

For example, when referring to a website as a general resource in your assignment, you should link to that website homepage in the reference list. However, if you cite specific content from a particular webpage on the website, you need to identify the specific webpage in your reference list.

The author can be an individual person or organisation.

Include the author's name (individual or corporate), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If a webpage does not have an author name (individual or organisation), use the title of the webpage in italics, followed by year of publication.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. Websites or webpages, however, do not have page numbers. In this case, since no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The examples below come from sources that do not have page numbers:

> COVID-19 and climate change have had such a huge impact on the world that they both 'have exacerbated malnutrition in all its forms and threatened the sustainability and resilience of food systems around the world' (WHO 2021).

> Heath (2021) explains that artificial intelligence is seen as being 'tied to a system's ability to adapt and improvise in a new environment, to generalise its knowledge and apply it to unfamiliar scenarios'.

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Malnutrition, as well as the supply and provision of food worldwide, have worsened on account of COVID-19 and climate change (WHO 2021).

> Artificial intelligence can be defined as the capacity of a system to adapt to unfamiliar environments, forming generalisations in its knowledge and using that knowledge in new situations (Heath 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Enclose publication year (e.g. 2021) in brackets after author. If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the site, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.

- If a website/webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name, start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author's name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- If an organisation's name is **both** the author of the website/webpage **and** the name of the website/webpage, use the abbreviated (shortened) form for the name of the website/webpage. Do this even if you have not used the abbreviated (shortened) form in your writing before. This avoid repetition of long names, e.g. DET website.

- Reference specific webpages rather than a whole website; pinpoint the specific location of information.

### Webpage document (PDF)                      

###### start-subtype-content

Do NOT use for government reports (they tend to report on a matter), organisational reports (e.g. annual reports, research conducted by the organisation and presented in a report), Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports or company/industry/market reports. To reference these reports, please see the relevant sections in EasyCite.

Use only for PDF documents NOT within any of the above categories.

The author may be a person/people, an organisation or a government department.

Include the author's name (individual or organisation), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If a downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name (individual or organisation), use the title of the document in italics, followed by year of publication.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. After the year, put a colon (:) followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The example below comes from a source that has a page number, i.e. 4:

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Students' capacity to learn increases when teachers collaborate to improve their educational practices (DET, Victoria 2020).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Enclose publication year (e.g. 2021) in brackets after author. If no publication year is supplied, write **n.d.** (for 'no date'). If the year can be reliably estimated or inferred from the site, then write **c.** (meaning 'circa' or approximately) followed by the year.

- If a website/webpage or downloadable webpage document (e.g. PDF) does not have an author name, start the reference with the title of the webpage or webpage document in italics, followed by year of publication.

- If the author's name is an organisation and you have used the abbreviated (shortened name) form in your in-text citations (e.g. WHO), include both the abbreviated (shortened name) form followed by the full version name in brackets, e.g. WHO (World Health Organization).

- If an organisation's name is **both** the author of the website/webpage **and** the name of the website/webpage, use the abbreviated (shortened) form for the name of the website/webpage. Do this even if you have not used the abbreviated (shortened) form in your writing before. This avoids repetition of long names, e.g. DET website.

- Italicise the document title.

- Include the word **website** after the name of the website. But if the name of the website is a URL (e.g. vic.gov.au), do not write the word **website**. Do not italicise the name of website.

- After website name, add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

- For documents that are available as PDF, provide a URL that links to the landing page where the PDF is located, not the URL that directly links to the PDF itself. If there is no landing page, provide a URL that directly links to the PDF.

Artworks and images (non-artworks) that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

When citing artworks or images (non-artworks) in the text of your assignment, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the figure layout (caption).

Citations are also influenced by where you sourced the artwork or image (non-artwork). Where possible, cite the original rather than copies from a reproduction.

How you capture and include the artwork or image (non-artwork), e.g. screenshot, photograph, copy-and-paste, does not influence the way in which it is referenced. Cite the work based on where you sourced the work.

**Note:** Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing artworks or images (non-artwork). Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

#### Captions

Captions are used to provide a description of the artworks or images (non-artwork) you use. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear and followed by a colon.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as 'Figure 7: Photograph by author' or 'Figure 11: Initial sketches' might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced. Check your lecturer's requirements.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. This can be in the sentence or in parentheses, for example (see Figure 1).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the "figure above" or "figure below" or "figure on page 3", for example.

**Note:**Your lecturer might require a specific long or short caption style. Whichever style you use, make sure you apply it consistently.

#### Captions (Own work)

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Description or explanation {/.figure-text}

##### Examples

> {.figure-text}Figure 1: Author’s photograph {/.figure-text}

> {.figure-text}Figure 2: Initial sketches of the design {/.figure-text}

#### Short captions for reproduced works

If the artwork or image (non-artwork) was on a website, include the URL (no full stop after URL) after the website name and the accessed date. If it was in a Library database, include the database name after the accessed date instead. If it was in a gallery, museum or other public space, include the name and location of the gallery, museum or public space. If it was in other sources, provide the in-text referencing details of the source as described in other areas of this guide.

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Artist's or Creator's family name Initial OR Gallery/Museum/Public Space name [if artist/creator] OR Organisation's name [if artist/creator] (year produced) *Title or description of artwork or image (non-artwork)* [format], publishing details of where artwork or image (non-artwork) was sourced. {/.figure-text}

#### In-text reference to artworks or images (non-artworks)

Italicise the titles of individual artworks or images (non-artworks) and use sentence case. If the artist/creator has made typographic decisions for the title where it has to appear in a certain way, use capitalisation, numbers or punctuation in exactly the same way as the artist/creator does in original title, e.g. *flight research #6*.

When first mentioning the work, include the artist or creator of the artwork or image (non-artwork), year of creation and title of the artwork or image (non-artwork) in parentheses, if not mentioned in the sentence.

If you use an artwork or image (non-artwork), refer to the figure number when you discuss it.

##### Examples

> The exhibition *Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion manifesto* displays the Chanel's (1925) little black dress in silk organza transformed black from being the colour of mourning to the height of chic and modernity (see Figure 11).

> The purchase of Pollock's (1952) *Blue poles*, as seen in Figure 12, created great controversy regarding the value of abstract art when it was purchased for the National Gallery of Australia.

> As illustrated in Figure 5, the painting *Swanston Street from the bridge* (Burn 1861) depicts Melbourne's growth into a city of domes and spires.

### Maps

###### start-subtype-content

RMIT Harvard identifies maps as a type of artwork. Please see section on **Artworks** for further details.

Maps taken from an online source can include:

- digitised maps that originate from a print source such as old maps and are made available in an electronic format by museums, galleries and libraries

- web maps that use satellite imagery and GPS data and are taken from online navigation and mapping sites such as Google Maps

Maps can also be in hardcopy/print format.

When citing maps in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1. within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and

2. in the figure layout (caption).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the "figure above" or "figure below" or "figure on page 3", for example.

The cartographer (author) can be a person or an organisation.


#### Captions

If the map was on a website, include the URL (no full stop after URL) after the accessed date. If the map appeared in other sources, provide the in-text referencing details of the source as described in other areas of this guide.

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Cartographer's family name Initial OR Organisation's name [if cartographer] (year produced) *Title of map* [format], Publishing details of where map was sourced. {/.figure-text}

##### Examples

> {.figure-text}Figure 9: Kearney J (1855) *Melbourne and its suburbs: map 1* [digitised map], State Library of Victoria website, accessed 13 December 2021. https<nolink>://www.slv.vic.gov.au/search-discover/explore-collections-format/maps/maps-melbourne-city-suburbs {/.figure-text}

#### In-text references

If you use a map, refer to the figure number when you discuss it.

> As shown by Figure 9, *Melbourne and its suburbs: map 1* depicts...(Kearney 1855).

> Figure 9 depicts...(Kearney 1855).

> As illustrated in Figure 10, *Plenty Road Bundoora 3083* highlights...(VicPlan 2020).

> As shown in Figure 10,...(VicPlan 2020).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- The cartographer (author) can be a person or an organisation.

- Add the map title in italics. After the title, provide the format of the resource in square brackets, e.g. [digital map], [print map], [digitised map]. 'Print map' is for hardcopy maps.  'Digitised map' is for maps that used to be in hardcopy (print) format but have now been digitised. 'Digital map' is for an online map sourced from a website or Library database that was created digitally/electronically – most maps are like this today.

- **Hardcopy (print):** add the name of publisher and place published.

- **Online -- from a website:** add the website name followed by the word **website**. Then put the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

- **Online -- from a Library database:** add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021), then the database name followed by the word **database**.

### Tables and diagrams

###### start-subtype-content

When citing tables, graphs or other diagrams in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1. within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and

2. in the table/figure layout (caption).

Label **tables** sequentially as **Table 1, Table 2** and so on, followed by a colon. Other **graphs and diagrams** are labelled sequentially as **Figure 1, Figure 2** and so on.

Include a title that describes or explains the information in the table or diagram. Note, this is not italicised.

Refer to a table or figure by its assigned number (e.g. Table 1, Figure 2), not as the "table/figure below" or "table/figure above" or "table/figure on page 3", for example.

For tables, graphs and diagrams using published content, acknowledge the source below the table/figure number and title, on a new line.

#### Tables (your own work)

When the information is your own work based on data you have collected independently, for example, from your own research or experiments, label your table with a number and give a title to the work. Use standard font (no italics).

##### Example

> Table 1: Comparison of results from groups A, B and C

#### Tables (adapted from published material)

If you are using information gathered from published information but are presenting it in a table or figure that you have created, acknowledge the source as you would for paraphrased information in a caption.

When the table includes data from more than one source, you must cite all sources you relied on to create the table.

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Title of table {/.figure-text}
> {.figure-text}Source: adapted from Publishing details of where the information was sourced {/.figure-text}

##### Examples

> {.figure-text}Table 2: Reason why students plagiarise {/.figure-text}
> {.figure-text}Source: adapted from Bretag et al. 2020 {/.figure-text}

> Table 3: Fluctuation in imports 2010 to 2020  
> Source: adapted from Mitchelton 2018; ABS 2019; DFAT 2020

#### Tables (reproduced from published material)

If you are using a table or graph that has been published elsewhere, acknowledge the source and provide the same details you would for quoted information.

##### Rule

> {.figure-text}Figure number: Title of table {/.figure-text}
> {.figure-text}Source: Publishing details of where the information was sourced {/.figure-text}

##### Examples

> {.figure-text}Table 4: Prison demographics in Australia {/.figure-text}
> {.figure-text}Source: AIHW 2018:1 {/.figure-text}

> {.figure-text}Figure 10: Buy now, pay later payments in Australia {/.figure-text}
> {.figure-text}Source: Fisher, Holland and West 2021:61 {/.figure-text}

#### In-text references - examples

If you use a table, graph or diagram, refer to the table or figure number when you discuss it.

> Bretag et al. (2020) identified a number of factors that contributed to plagiarism as listed in Table 2.

> Fluctuations in the imports over the last decade are represented in Table 3.

> Table 4 highlights current prison demographics in Australia, based on data compiled by AIHW (2018).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list, reference tables and diagrams in accordance with the source they appear in. For example, if the table or diagram appears in a book or journal article, you reference the book or journal article. Please refer to the relevant section(s) within this guide for how to reference the various sources.

### Legal material

###### start-subtype-content

Take care to give accurate and complete details about legislation (Acts) and legal cases. The *Legal Material* section of the <a href="https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material" target="_blank">Australian Government Style Manual</a> (opens in a new tab) provides more detail and examples regarding the use of legal materials.

For **Acts of Parliament (legislation)** and **Bills**, a pinpoint is a reference to a specific page, paragraph or other section of the Act, e.g. pt 3 div 2 s 16, add **only** if applicable. Pinpoint references should appear as abbreviations and a number separated by a space. Pinpoints are placed after the abbreviated jurisdiction.

#### Act of Parliament (legislation)

When discussing government policies and services that require you to refer to the relevant law(s), the title of the Act of Parliament (legislation) is generally placed first, followed by the relevant subsections.

Depending on the context, you might need to refer to specific sections, paragraphs and subparagraphs using a pinpoint reference.

The units are written in lower case unless they begin a sentence. Units of an Act can be written in long or abbreviated form. Do not begin sentences with the abbreviated form.

##### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available) or pinpoint reference.

> Reportable matters under the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic) are an acknowledgement that 'the protection of children is the paramount consideration in the context of child abuse' (para 16B(1)(b)).

> Section 55 of the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) sch 2 ('Australian Consumer Law') states that 'there is a guarantee that the goods are reasonably fit for any disclosed purpose, and for any purpose for which the supplier represents that they are reasonably fit'.

##### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Section 5A of the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic) outlines the principles for compliance with child safety standards.

> Multiple jurisdictions have laws pertaining to the management of water supply in the Murray-Darling Basin, including the *Water Act 1989* (Vic), *Natural Resources Management Act 2004* (SA) and *Water Act 2007* (Cth).

##### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- For an **Act of Parliament (legislation)**, include the title of the Act and year in italics, followed by the abbreviated jurisdiction in parentheses (e.g. Vic, Cth, etc.). For example, 'Commonwealth' is abbreviated to (Cth). Do not italicise the jurisdiction. Include the jurisdiction either in the sentence (e.g. 'The Victorian government's...') or in parenthesis as an abbreviation after the Act's title. Ensure the abbreviation does not have full stops, e.g. (Vic).

- If applicable, add a pinpoint after the jurisdiction.

**Rule**

> *Title of Act Year* (abbreviated jurisdiction).

**Examples**

> *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic).

### Student's own work (previously submitted)

###### start-subtype-content

You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

**Note:** Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.

Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/assessment" target="_blank">Assessment Declaration</a>.

The *Australian Government Style Manual (AGSM)* does not provide information on how to cite your own work. The following is based on how to cite theses from the AGSM.

**If it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work:**

- You can quote or paraphrase from your previous work, but take care to contextualise what you quote or paraphrase to your new work.

- Treat yourself as the author and your own previous work as an unpublished paper.

- Include the year that you submitted your previous work.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. If your previously submitted work has a page number, put a colon (:) after the year followed by the page number. If no page number is available and the quote comes from written work, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

> 'Risk taking behaviours align with certain personality traits or disorders' (Smith 2021:13).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> An interview with a marketing manager at a leading women's fashion retailer revealed that...(Smith 2021).

> Smith (2021) previously found that...

If your original assignment contained critique or commentary about other sources that you base your ideas on in your new assignment, you should also include those citations in your new assignment. For example, if you had criticised Presley and Dietrich in your earlier paper that you previously submitted, you might have something like this:

> According to Smith (2021), the claims of Priestly and Dietrich (2009) are out-dated and do not apply to the case currently being examined.

> I have not included Priestly and Dietrich’s (2009) model in this analysis because I believe their claims are not relevant to current work practices (Smith 2021).

#### Reference list entry

If it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work, in your reference list:

- Treat yourself as the author and your own previous work as an unpublished paper.

- Include the year that you submitted your previous work.

- Put the title of your previous work in italics.

- After the title, provide the format of your previous work and the course code in square brackets, e.g. [unpublished paper for course code]. For example: [unpublished paper for HRHR1001].

- The location is the city of the University. Add only if it is not inferred by the University name.

##### Rule

> Student family name Initial (Year) *Title of previous work* [format], Name of University, Location of University [if not inferred by university name].

##### Using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and research, including assessment tasks
The educators within your courses can tell you if you are able to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including how you can use the tools and what tools you can use. If you use any AI tools, you must appropriately acknowledge and reference the use of these tools and their outputs. Failure to reference the use of these tools can result in academic misconduct. 

**Please confirm with your course educator** before using any AI tools in your assessment tasks. 

**Please note** that the guidelines on how to reference AI tools have been updated on Monday the 26th of June 2023. This is in response to updated guidelines from the APA style manual editors, as well as the new ability to generate shareable URLs in some of the AI tools.

##### Overview of text-generating AI tools

**Introduction to AI tools that can generate text**

AI tools that generate text, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are large language models with a conversational type of interface, where you can ask a question, receive a detailed response and follow up with additional queries. 

Some generative AI tools are not connected to the internet and are trained on data sets up to a specific time point. Other generative AI tools connect to the internet and will provide URL links to information. There are some points to consider when using the text generated by these tools: 

- As these tools function in a similar way to predictive text on your phone, by recognising and reproducing patterns in language, they can generate incorrect information.
- While they can produce citations and references, these are not always correct. If you are relying on the information to be accurate, you should check that the reference cited by the AI tool exists, and that the information cited is present in the original source.
- The data sets used to train these tools often include biased and inaccurate information, as access to scholarly information and valid scientific studies may be limited, and information from social media and other less reputable sources is included.

The [Learning Lab Artificial Intelligence Tools module](https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/artificial-intelligence-tools) has more information on how these AI tools work, and some points to consider when using them. 

**Copyright and non-human authors**

Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors and creators. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective an AI tool cannot be [recognised as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of the work. This has informed our referencing guidance.

**General acknowledgement that AI tools have been used in the creation of a work**

In some assessment tasks, you may be able to use AI tools for background research, or to generate an outline for your essay or report (as stated earlier, please follow your educator's guidance before using any AI tools).. In this case, rather than citing and referencing specific text generated by AI tools, you will need to provide a general acknowledgement within the body or methods section of your text to explain that an AI tool was used in the creation of your work. Include as much detail as possible, including how you used the AI tool, the prompt used, the date you used the tool, and the name, creator and version of the AI tool.  

Example: On the 26th June 2023, I used the May 24 version of OpenAI's ChatGPT to perform background research by using the following prompt "explain the difference between deep learning and machine learning". 

**Referencing specific text content generated by AI tools**

Each of the referencing styles used at RMIT is based on a source style manual. More information on the source style manuals used for each style can be found in [Easy Cite](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/). Currently, only the editors of the APA  style manual have provided advice on referencing AI-generated content. For the other referencing styles used at RMIT, we have created interim guidelines for referencing AI-generated content that we believe are the best match within that style. These may change in the future as the source style manuals develop or update their guidelines for referencing AI-generated content.  

If you are referring to content generated by AI tools within your work, we recommend that you include the shareable link to the content if available, or otherwise include this AI-generated content as an appendix or supplemental information. It is also good practice to include the question or prompt that generated the response to provide context for your readers. 

Two sets of reference guidelines are provided below for each style - one is for AI tools that include shareable URLs to the outputs generated from text prompts, which enables your readers to access the outputs themselves.  The other is for AI tools that do not provide shareable links, meaning that the readers of your work cannot access the same information themselves.

##### Using generative AI in learning and research, including assessment tasks
Your course lecturer can tell you if you are able to use content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools in your assessment tasks, including AI-generated images. **Please confirm with your course lecturer** for a specific assessment task before using any AI tools.

If you are able to use AI tools in your assessment task, you need to appropriately acknowledge and reference all of the AI-generated content that you include. Failure to reference this AI-generated content can result in [academic misconduct](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/assessment-results/academic-integrity).

**Please note** that the information about using generative AI tools will continue to be updated - we recommend checking this guide regularly and confirming with your course lecturer if you are unsure.

##### Overview of images generated by AI tools

Some generative AI tools have been trained on large numbers of existing images, and these tools can create new images based on prompts from users. The images created using these tools can be downloaded, but they are not published or reproducible in the AI platform. Images generated using AI tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E 2 are the topic of much debate.  Current copyright law only recognises humans as authors. One of the moral rights associated with copyright is the right to be acknowledged as the author of a work. From a copyright perspective there is currently no obligation to [recognise AI as the creator of a work](https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/artificial-intelligence-ai-and-copyright/), however it is important to explain that AI was used in the creation of the work.  

AI-generated images are an emerging technology, and there are not yet clear guidelines for how to incorporate them into existing referencing styles such as APA 7th, Chicago, etc. Our current recommendation for how to reference AI-generated images varies for each referencing style, and is included below. Additionally, we recommend that you include the question or prompt that generated the image where possible, to provide context for your readers. 

**Please note** that our recommendations for how to reference AI-generated content may change in the future as referencing style manuals are updated.

#### How to reference AI-generated text in RMIT Harvard - interim guidelines
The [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/author-date), on which our RMIT Harvard referencing style is based, currently contains no guidelines for referencing AI-generated content, and also has no guidelines for referencing software programs. As the RMIT Harvard style is similar to the APA 7th style, we have based the interim guidelines for RMIT Harvard on the current APA guidelines for referencing AI-generated content, adapted to match the RMIT Harvard style. Please note these are interim guidelines and these may be updated in the future if the Australian Government Style Manual editors release formal advice.

Use the name of the creator of the tool as the author and include both an in-text citation and a reference list entry. If a shareable URL to the content is available, include it in your reference list entry. If the content is not shareable, include the prompt used and the generated text in an appendix, and refer to the appendix in the reference list entry.

<!-- using heading 5 (#####) for sub-heading within this text -->
##### In-text citations:
For in-text citations, use the creator of the AI tool as the author (i.e., OpenAI), and the year of the version of the AI model that you have used.   

**Rule for narrative (author-prominent) citations: Author (year)**
> Example 1: OpenAI (2023)

> Example 2: Google (2023)

**Rule for parenthetical (information-prominent) citations: (Author, year)**
> Example 1: (OpenAI 2023)

> Example 2: (Google 2023)

<!-- using heading 5 (#####) for sub-heading within this text -->
##### Reference list entry example - shareable URL generated by the AI tool:
**Rule**
> Author (Year) _Title of software program_ (Version) [Format], Publisher*, accessed Day Month Year. URL

*Note: when the publisher and author name are the same, do not repeat the publisher name after the format, and instead move directly to the accessed date and URL.

**Example**
> OpenAI (2023) _ChatGPT_ (May 24 version) [Large language model], accessed 26 June 2023. https<nolink>://chat.openai.com/share/81f2e81f-f137-41b6-9881-39af1672ae3c

<!-- using heading 5 (#####) for sub-heading within this text -->
##### Reference list entry example - non-shareable AI-generated content:
**Rule**
> Author (Year) _Title of software program_ (Version) [Format], Publisher*, accessed Day Month Year. Appendix.

*Note: when the publisher and author name are the same, do not repeat the publisher name after the format, and instead move directly to the accessed date and appendix.

**Example**
> Google (2023) _Bard_ (2023.06.07 version) [Large language model], accessed 26 June 2023. See Appendix for text generated and prompt used.

#### How to reference AI-generated images in RMIT Harvard - guidelines
The RMIT Harvard style contains information for [using and referencing images](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/?styleguide=styleguide-1#stn-8), including that artworks and images that you use in your assessment tasks do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

<!-- using heading 5 (#####) for sub-heading within this text -->
##### AI-generated images reproduced in a published source:
If using reproduced images, reference the published source. In a caption below the image add a figure number and information about the image, including the published source. We currently recommend including the information that the artwork was generated using AI in the format field.  Also include the published source in your reference list using the standard RMIT Harvard guidelines for the relevant source (e.g. a newspaper article).

**Caption**

**Rule**
> Figure number: Creator's family name Initial [if artist/creator is known] OR leave blank if artist/creator unknown (year produced) _Title or description of artwork or image_ [format], publishing details of where artwork or image was sourced

**Example**
> Figure 1: Allen JM (2022) _Théâtre D’opéra Spatial_ [artwork generated using Midjourney], Roose K (2 September 2022) 'An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy.', _The New York Times_, accessed 3 March 2023. https<nolink>://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html

<!-- using heading 5 (#####) for sub-heading within this text -->
##### AI-generated images that you produce:
Include the image in your work with a caption that explains that the work was generated by an AI tool, and what prompt was used. No reference list entry is required for an AI-generated image that you have produced.

**Caption**

**Rule**
> Figure number: Description or explanation

**Example**
> Figure 1: Image generated using OpenAI's DALL-E 2 from the prompt ...
