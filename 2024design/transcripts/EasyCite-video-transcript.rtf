\f0 \cf2 The details of the referencing source sub-type sit in the main body of the screen. This provides detailed options about your source material. For example: it shows how to cite a book with multiple authors, or how to cite figures / photos or diagrams you might use in your assignment

\f0 Note that each referencing style outlines the general principles of how to use that style. This \'91Using\'92 tab explains important information about the style. It gives general rules for in-text and reference list citations, and an example of a reference list. Please read these rules carefully

\f0 \cf2 When using information from a source text, you can express it as a direct quote or a paraphrase.  
\f1 \

\f0 When directly quoting, you \ul must\ulnone  use the exact words of the author and put them in quotation marks.   
\f1 \

\f0 Be sure to keep direct quotes to a minimum.\'a0
\f1 \'a0\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri-1\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf2 The paraphrase in-text example will be suitable if you\'92re using your own words to express an author\'92s idea. Paraphrasing is the preferred method of citing information.
\f1 \
\

\f0 If writing a reference list citation, you must have bibliographic details such as author names, year of publication, book title and publisher details
\f1 .

\

\f0 Each different referencing style requires different elements and formatting. Make sure to pay close attention to the order of these elements. 
\f1 \
\

\f0 Pay attention to the use of capitalisation, italics, commas, and colons, as well as formatting such as hanging indents. These are just as important for presenting the citation accurately.

\

\f0 You can send your selection to a printer for a hard copy or choose to save it as a PDF file for off-line access.
