		<h2>Using Harvard</h2>
		<h3>Introduction to Harvard</h3>
		<p><b>Important: this is a guide only.</b> To avoid losing marks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Confirm referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer</li>
			<li>Use Snooks & Co 2002, <a target="_blank" href="https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9911447940001341">Style manual for authors, editors and printers,</a> 6th edn, John Wiley & Sons, Milton QLD. to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Harvard is an author-date referencing style.</p>
		<p>Harvard style requires in-text references and the reference list.</p>
		<p><b>In-text references</b> appear within the body of the document. They include the author(s) family name and the year of publication, with extra details if required, such as page numbers.</p>
		<p><b>A reference list</b> provides full details of all in-text references at the end of the document.</p>

<!-- 72 General rules for in-text referencing -->
<div id="infobox-answer-generalrulesintext" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using Harvard</h2>
		<h3>General rules for in-text references</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use in-text references to acknowledge each author or source of information (print or online) used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.</li>
			<li>In-text reference details include the author(s) family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with extra information if required, such as page numbers.</li>
			<li>An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.  If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, only the date (and page number for direct quote) is in parentheses immediately after the author's name.</li>
			<li>Use an ampersand (&) when listing authors in parentheses. For example: (Lewis & Lewis 2015). Use the full word 'and' when mentioning an author(s) in a sentence. For example: Lewis and Lewis (2015) ... .</li>
			<li>When a work has two or three authors, always list all author(s) names every time the reference occurs in the text.</li>
			<li>When a work has four or more authors, list the first author(s) name followed by et al. For example: Haslam et al. (2013) ... or (Haslam et al. 2013).</li>
			<li>If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.</li>
			<li>If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use n.d.</li>
			<li>If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text then use c. (meaning 'circa') before the year</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Direct quote</h3>
		<p>A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s).</p>
		<p>Do not overuse direct quotes.</p>
		<p>Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number.</p>
		<p>If no page number is available, include the location of the quote using a paragraph number or section heading. Abbreviate the word paragraph to para. with a period afterward.</p>
		<p>If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots (...) and another space. For example: Cannon (2012, p. 165) argues that 'changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas ... will require coherent change strategies'.</p>
		<p>An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.</p>
		<h4>Beginning of a sentence</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Cannon (2012, p. 165) argues that 'changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas as hazard reduction, resource use, waste, pollution, etc. will require coherent change strategies'.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Middle of a sentence</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In a post about the emotions involved in undertaking a literature review, the Thesis Whisper (2013, para. 16) notes that 'elation when you realise you know more than your supervisor about your topic and you feel brave enough to argue about it' is one of the top five PhD emotions.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>End of a sentence</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>'Results broadly apply to managers in the tourism, hospitality, and service industries' (Hosany & Martin 2012, Managerial implications section).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Block quotations</h3>
		<p>Quotes of more than 30 words in length are known as block quotations.</p>
		<p>Block quotes need to start on a new line, be indented from the text margin and set in smaller text size without single inverted commas (quotation marks).</p>
		<p>At the end of the quote, include the reference details such as author name, year and page number(s) in parentheses.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Khoo's PhD research project in the area of architecture investigated:</p>
			<blockquote style="font-size: 85%;">
				<p>the application of alternative multifunctional material systems with possible form-changing and responsive capacities. These are integrated with physical computational processes for responsive morphing architectural design as an ‘integrated’ and ‘synergetic’ entity identical to single moulded devices such as the solid-state door handles developed by the automobile industry (2013, p. 10).</p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Paraphrasing</h3>
		<p>Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.</p>
		<p>An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.</p>
		<h4>Beginning of a sentence</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Ahmadjian (2006) noted that there has been disagreement over the influence of Japanese business groups on the economy.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Middle of a sentence</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Based on the novel of the same name, <i>Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky</i> (2010) follows the relationship between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>End of a sentence</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The City of Melbourne's population increased by 10.5 percent in the period between July 2012 and June 2013 (Martin 2014).</p>
		</blockquote>

<!-- 75 Referencing multiple works in the same year by the same authors -->
<div id="infobox-answer-sameauthor" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using Harvard</h2>
		<h3>Multiple works by the same author(s) in the same year</h3>
		<p>Identify works by the same author in the same year by adding letters a, b, c, and so forth, to the year in both the in-text reference and the reference list entry.</p>
		<h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
		<p>Paraphrasing is expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Jamison (1991a, 1991b) provides chiropractic information for diagnosing and health promotion.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Reference list entry</h4>
		<p>In the reference list, identify works by the same author(s) in the same year by adding letters a, b, c, and so forth to the year (for example: 1991a).</p>
		<p>Try to identify the sequence in which the works were published. If the sequence cannot be determined, put the references in alphabetical order by title.</p>
		<blockquote>

<div id="infobox-answer-personal" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
<div class="panecontents">
	<h2>Using Harvard</h2>
	<h3>Personal communication</h3>
	<p>Include personal communication, such as face-to-face interviews, conversations, telephone calls, letters or emails, in an in-text reference.</p>
	<p>Information about personal communication must be included in the in-text reference. Include the type of personal communication (for example: personal conversation, email, interview, telephone conversation) and the date in a date-month-year format.</p>
	<p>Personal conversation can be abbreviated to pers. conv. and a telephone conversation can be abbreviated to tel. conv.</p>
	<p>However, personal communication references <b>do not</b> need to be included in the reference list.</p>
	<blockquote>

		<h2>Using Harvard</h2>
		<h3>Secondary citation</h3>
		<p>Use a secondary citation to acknowledge the work of an author(s) that has been directly quoted or paraphrased in another author(s) work.</p>
		<p>In the in-text reference, include the original source of information and the source you have used. For example, if an article by Hosany and Martin cites Heath and Scott, refer to both Heath & Scott and Hosany & Martin.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Early research indicated... (Heath & Scott, cited in Hosany & Martin 2012).</p>
			<p>Heath and Scott (cited in Hosany & Martin 2012) claim that... </p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>In the reference list, include only the source you have used. In this example, you would only need to include the Hosany and Martin reference.</p>

<div id="infobox-answer-generalrulesreferencelist" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using Harvard</h2>
		<h3>General rules for the reference list</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a reference list at the end of the document to include the publication details of all the in-text references within your writing.</li>
			<li>Start a reference list on a new page using the heading <b>References</b> or <b>Reference List</b>.</li>
			<li>List only references included in your writing.</li>
			<li>If your lecturer/teacher or supervisor has also requested a bibliography, list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing under a heading of Bibliography.</li>
			<li>The reference list is arranged alphabetically by the family name of the author. If the author of a reference is a company or organisation, list the reference based on the first letter of the company or organisation name.</li>
			<li>If there are multiple entries by the same author, then arrange chronologically starting with the earliest year of publication.</li>
			<li>If there are several authors with the same family name, then arrange alphabetically by initials.</li>
			<li>If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.</li>
			<li>If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use n.d.</li>
			<li>If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text then use c. (meaning 'circa') before the year.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Place of publication</h3>
		<p>If there is no place of publication use n.p. (for ‘no place’).</p>
		<p>If the place of publication is not commonly known (for example: Harlow) or the place of publication could be located in two or more countries, additional information is required.</p>
		<p>For Australia and the United States, add the abbreviated name of the State.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Fitzroy, VIC or Delmar, NY</p>
		</blockquote>

<div id="infobox-answer-chapter" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Books</h2>
		<p>Generally, an edited book includes chapters written by different authors.</p>
		<h3>Book chapter</h3>
		<p>When using a book chapter in an in-text reference, use the author(s) details of the chapter and not the editor(s) details of the book.</p>
		<p>If there is no chapter author, use the title of the chapter instead of the author details in the in-text reference and in the reference list.</p>
		<p>If you use an edited book (where the chapters have no identifying author(s) details) in an in-text reference, use the editor(s) family name(s) as the author(s).</p>
		<h4>Direct quote in-text</h4>
		<p>A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>'Business groups have been seen as both the powerhouses behind Japanese industrialization and the culprits behind Japan’s decade-long inertia' (Ahmadjian 2006, p. 29).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Paraphrasing in-text</h4>
		<p>Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Ahmadjian (2006) noted that there has been disagreement over the influence of Japanese business groups on the economy.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Reference list entry</h4>
		<p>In your reference list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use (ed.) for a single editor and (eds) for two or more editors.</li>
			<li>Use the editor(s) name with initials before the family name (for example: S Chang).</li>
			<li>Enclose the chapter title in single inverted commas (quotation marks).</li>
			<li>After the chapter title, insert the word '<strong>in</strong>' before the name of the editor(s).</li>
			<li>Add page numbers after the place of publication.</li>
		</ul>

		</blockquote>
		<h3>Edited book</h3>
		<p>Generally, an edited book will only appear in a bibliography list. A bibliography is used to list any other sources that you have read but not included in your writing. Check with your lecturer/teacher or supervisor if you need to provide a bibliography.</p>
		<p>In the bibliography list, for an edited book, add (ed.) for a single editor and (eds) for two or more editors.</p>
		<p>If you have used an edited book as part of an in-text reference and need to add the book details to a reference list, use the same format as the bibliography list entry.</p>
		<p>If the role of editor (compiler, reviser or translator) is important to the work cite the work by their name rather than the author’ names.</p>
		<p>If the author’s role remains of primary importance to the work cite the work using the author’s name and acknowledge the editor (compiler, reviser or translator) in the reference list.</p>
		<p>If there is no author, use the name of the editor (compiler, reviser or translator).</p>
		<p>Use the abbreviations ed., eds, comps, rev. and trans. as appropriate.</p>

	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Other sources</h2>
		<p>Generally, conference papers are published within conference proceedings, either online or in print. In most cases, a conference paper (rather than the conference proceedings) will be used as a reference.</p>
		<p>As details will vary for conference papers, try to extract as much information as you can about authorship and publication information etc.</p>
		<h3>Conference paper from a webpage</h3>
		<p>A conference paper from a webpage will generally be sourced from the conference's website or the website of the organisation hosting the conference.</p>
		<h4>Direct quote</h4>
		<p>A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number.</p>
		<p>If no page number is available, include the location of the quote using a paragraph number or a section heading. The word paragraph can be abbreviated to para.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>'Focusing on self-leadership skill awareness and development, the unit thus requires that students engage in a critical self-reflection process' (Gudmundsson &amp; Laing 2011, p. 108).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
		<p>Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Gudmunsson and Laing (2011) argue that for a successful blended learning environment students need support.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Reference list entry</h4>
		<p>In the reference list:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Enclose the title of the conference paper in single inverted commas (quotation marks).</li>
			<li>Capitalise and italicise the name of the conference. For example: <i>Space Safety is No Accident The 7th IAASS Conference</i>.</li>
			<li>Include the name of the conference host (for example: Curtin University), location and date of the conference.</li>
			<li>Include page numbers (if available).</li>
			<li>Add the viewed date (for example: viewed 5 August 2016) and the URL address enclosed in angled brackets (&lt; and &gt;) after the name of the conference host, location and date of the conference (if supplied).</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>

		</blockquote>
		<p><strong>For conference papers sourced from printed conference proceedings</strong>, use the guidelines for a chapter from an edited book.</p>
		<p>If the title of the conference proceedings contains the name of the conference, capitalise the name of the conference. For example: Geospatial data in a changing world selected papers of the 19th AGILE Conference on Geographic Information Science.</p>
		<blockquote>

		<h3>Student's own work</h3>
		<p>You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice.  Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.</p>
		<p>Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.</p>
		<p>Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment Declaration<span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>

		<p>If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.</p>
		<h4>Paraphrasing in-text</h4>
		<p>When paraphrasing, include your family name and year of previous work in brackets. Or, if referring to your family name in the body of the text, then just include the year of previous work in brackets immediately after your family name.</p>
		<p>For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Studies indicate that … (Smith 2018).</p>
			<p>Smith (2018) noted that …</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>According to Smith (2018), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (2009) …</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Direct quote in-text</h4>
		<p>Place direct quotes between single quotation marks ' ' and provide the page number from the previous work.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>'Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders' (Smith 2018, p. 3).</p>

	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using APA 7th ed.</h2>
		<h3>General rules for in-text citations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>When citing a work with a single author provide the author's family name and year of publication.</li>
			<li>When a work has two authors, always cite both family names every time the reference occurs in the text.</li>
			<li>When a work has three or more authors, cite only the family name of the first author followed by <b>et al.</b> and the year of publication.</li>
			<li>When using exact words that an author has used, you must enclose these in double quotation marks <b>“ ”</b> and supply an in-text citation, including page number(s).</li>
			<li>In your writing, you must acknowledge each author or source of information (whether print or online) either by <b>paraphrasing</b> or using a <b>direct quote.</b></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
		<p>Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words. When paraphrasing, use round brackets to add the author(s) family name and the year of publication, or use the author(s) family name as part of your sentence, followed by the year of publication in round brackets.</p>
		<p><i>Note: When paraphrasing, the citation details can be used at the beginning, middle or end of the sentence.</i></p>
		<h4>Citation at the beginning</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Brophy (2010) states that student motivation . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Citation in the middle</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>. . . motivation is evident (Brophy, 2010), and as a result, can contribute significantly to achieving learning goals.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Citation at the end</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>. . . where a number of subjective experiences can inform motivational outcomes (Brophy, 2010).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>Note: Citations can also be structured according to whether they give prominence to the author (narrative), or to the information being conveyed (parenthetical).</i></p>
		<h4>Narrative citations</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In his research, Brophy (2010) argues that . . .</p>
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			<p>. . . findings are based on the qualitative study of behavioural learning (Brophy, 2010).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Including page numbers in a paraphrase citation</h4>
		<p>When paraphrasing, page numbers may also be included as part of the citation, especially if it helps the reader to locate the source of the information in a lengthy document.</p>
		<p><i>Note: Including page numbers when paraphrasing is optional and is <b>NOT</b> a requirement of the APA referencing style.</i></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In order to establish a learning community in the classroom, it is important to motivate students by addressing both individual and collaborative learning goals (Brophy, 2010, pp. 23-24).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Direct quotes</h4>
		<p>Direct quotes are used when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between double quotation marks and add a page number. Do <b>NOT</b> overuse direct quotes.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>“Student motivation to learn can be viewed as either a general disposition or a situation-specific state” (Brophy, 2010, p. 12).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Citing a source with no page number(s)</h4>
		<p>If the work you are referencing does NOT contain page numbers, then use paragraph numbers, chapter numbers or section headings as part of the in-text reference.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"As the national peak body for early childhood, ECA is a regular, and trusted, contributor to the public policy debate on all matters affecting young children (birth to eight years) and their families" (Early Childhood Australia, 2016, Advocacy section, para. 1).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Omitting words from a direct quote</h4>
		<p>If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots (. . .) and another space.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Cannon (2012) argues that "changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas . . . will require coherent change strategies" (p. 165).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>Note: Quotes more than <b>40 words</b> in length need to be in <b>block</b> form – without using quotation marks, begin the quote on a new, indented line, and double-space the entire quote. At the end of the quote, include citation details such as author(s), year and page number(s) in brackets.</i></p>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p style="line-height: 2;">The difference between intrinsic motivation and motivation to learn is closely related to the difference between affective and cognitive engagement experiences. Intrinsic motivation refers primarily to affective experience—enjoyment of the processes involved in engaging in an activity. In contrast, motivation to learn is primarily a cognitive experience involving attempts to make sense of the information that an activity conveys, to relate this information to prior knowledge, and to master the skills that the activity develops. (Brophy, 2010, p. 12)</p>

		<p>The information and examples below outline how to reference a table where the information in the table has been derived from another source or sources.</p>
		<p><i>Note: If a table that you create in your written work is entirely your own and does <b>not</b> include information from other sources, you should include a table number (in bold) and a brief title (italicised).</i></p>
		<p><i>Note: If you are copying an entire table from another source without altering the layout or combining its data from other sources, you should then reference it as per the other examples in the <b>Images</b> section e.g. book/journal article, webpage etc.</i></p>
		<h4>In-text citation</h4>
		<p>When citing tables in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:
		<p style="padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -4em;">1. within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and</p>
		<p style="padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -4em;">2. in the table layout include table number, brief title and notes</p>
		<p>Refer to the table by its assigned number. Do NOT refer to the table as “the Table above/below”, or “the Table on page 17”.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>As shown in Table 5 . . .</p>
			<p>Table 5 illustrates . . .</p>
			<p>The data shows . . . (Table 5).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Table layout</h4>
		<p><u>Table caption</u></p>
		<p>A table that cites other sources will include a double-spaced caption with the following elements above the table: label of table in bold (e.g. <b>Table 5</b>) followed by the title of the table (in italics).</p>
		<p><u>Names of studies included within table</u></p>
		<p>If the information in the table includes references to relevant sources, then notes below the table are not required (this is commonly the case with summary tables of previous studies).</p>
		<p><b>Table 5</b></p>
		<p><i>Summary of studies about gait rehabilitation after stroke</i></p>

		<p><u>Superscript letters representing sources used</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a superscript lower-case letter to indicate in the table any in-text citations used.</li>
			<li>If direct quotes are used, quotation marks should be used in the table.</li>
			<li>Provide a note below the table organised according to where the superscripts appear in the table following the left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.</li>
			<li>If direct quotes are used, page numbers must be included in the in-text citation.</li>

		<h2>Other sources</h2>
		<h3>Student's own work</h3>
		<p>You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.</p>
		<p>Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.</p>
		<p>Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment Declaration. <span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>
			<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-edit fa-external-link"></i></a>
		<p>The <i>Publication manual of the American Psychological Association</i> does not provide information on how to cite your own work. The following is based on how to cite dissertations and theses.</p>
		<p>If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.</p>
		<h4>Paraphrasing in-text</h4>
		<p>When paraphrasing, include your family name and year of previous work in brackets. Or, if referring to your family name in the body of the text, then just include the year of previous work in brackets immediately after your family name.</p>
		<p>For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Studies indicate that . . . (Smith, 2018).</p>
			<p>Smith (2018) noted that . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>According to Smith (2018), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (2009) . . .</p>

		<h4>Direct quote in-text</h4>
		<p>Place direct quotes between double quotation marks " " and provide the page number from the previous work.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders" (Smith, 2018, p. 3).</p>

<!-- 203 General principles -->
<div id="infobox-answer-aglcprinciples" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using AGLC4</h2>
		<h3>General principles</h3>
		<p>The AGLC4 style consists of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Footnotes to provide information about sources used in your work.</li>
			<li>Within the text of your work, footnote numbers (using a superscript) are positioned after punctuation.</li>
			<li>Footnotes appear at the end of each page of your work.</li>
			<li>Use a full stop at the end of each footnote.</li>
			<li>Separate multiple sources in a footnote with a semicolon (;).</li>
			<li>A <b>Pinpoint</b> is the particular page, paragraph or chapter number from which you have sourced information.</li>
			<li>The first time a source is cited, it is cited in full. Thereafter, it is appropriate to use either <b>'ibid'</b> or <b>'n'</b>. See AGLC section 1.4.</li>
			<li>If a <b>bibliography</b> is required it should be provided at the end of the paper. Give details of each source mentioned in the text, as well as details of other sources consulted in preparing the paper.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>In-text example</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Recent developments in Australian law following the decision of the High Court <i>in IceTV Pty Ltd v Network Nine Australia Pty Ltd</i> illustrate a fundamental shift in the approach of courts regarding the importance and form of authorship.<sup>1</sup></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b>Footnote example</b></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>1</sup> <i>IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd</i> [2009] HCA 14.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Pinpoint references</h3>
		<p>A pinpoint reference within a footnote directs the reader to a particular place in the cited work:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For sources such as cases, books or journal articles, a pinpoint reference might refer the reader to a particular chapter, page or paragraph.</li>
			<li>For legislative materials, pinpoint references can also refer to parts, sections, clauses or divisions.</li>
			<li>A pinpoint reference is provided at the end of the footnote.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>See section 3.1.4 of the <a target="_blank" href="http://law.unimelb.edu.au/mulr/aglc">AGLC4 <span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>
		<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-edit fa-external-link"></i></a> for a full list of abbreviations used in pinpoint references for legislative materials.</p>
		<h3>Repeat citations</h3>
		<p>When a source is cited more than once in a paper the full bibliographic details should only be provided in the first instance.</p>
		<p>The terms <b>'Ibid'</b> and <b>'n'</b> are used for repeat citations of the same work. In some circumstances, <b>'above (n)'</b> or <b>'below (n)'</b> are used to direct the reader to a specific part or reference within a text.</p>
		<p><b>Using 'Ibid'</b></p>
		<p>Use 'Ibid' in a footnote where the immediately preceding footnote refers to the same work. The exception to this rule is if a footnote lists more than one source (in this case use 'n').</p>
		<p>If a footnote refers to the same work and to the same pinpoint reference, simply use 'Ibid'. The pinpoint reference does not need to be repeated in this case.</p>
		<p>If a footnote refers to the same work but to a different pinpoint reference, use 'Ibid' followed by the pinpoint reference.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>1</sup> <i>IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd</i> [2009] HCA 14.</p>
			<p><sup>2</sup> Ibid.</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup> Ibid HCA 15-16.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><b>Using 'n'</b></p>
		<p>Use ‘n’ to refer to a source that has been cited in a previous footnote other than the immediately preceding one.</p>
		<p>If citing a source that has already been referred to then a shortened form of the citation should be provided (e.g. shortened author name or title), along with the footnote number <b>(n)</b> in parentheses. Also include the pinpoint if different from the first citation.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>1</sup> <i>IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd</i> [2009] HCA 14.</p>
			<p>...</p>
			<p><sup>4</sup> <i>IceTV</i> (n 1) HCA 17.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Note: If referring to a specific part/s or reference/s within a text then use <b>'above (n)'</b> or <b>'below (n)'</b> where appropriate. See AGLC section 1.4.2 for further details.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><sup>5</sup> See above n 1 and accompanying text.</p>
			<p><sup>6</sup> See below n 7 Part II(A).</p>

<div id="infobox-answer-aglcbibliographyrules" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using AGLC4</h2>
		<h3>General rules for the bibliography</h3>
		<p>If a bibliography is required list all works referred to both in footnotes and in the body of your assignment, as well as all works consulted in writing your assignment.</p>
		<p>The bibliography is divided into sections as outlined in AGLC 1.13:</p>
		<p>A. <i>Articles/Books/Reports</i></p>
		<p>B. <i>Cases</i></p>
		<p>C. <i>Legislation</i></p>
		<p>D. <i>Treaties</i></p>
		<p>E. <i>Other</i></p>

		<h2>Other sources</h2>
		<h3>Student's own work</h3>
		<p>You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.</p>

	<h3>Introduction to the Vancouver referencing style</h3>
	<p><b>Important:</b> This is a guide only. To avoid losing marks:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Confirm the referencing requirements of your school with your lecturer, and</li>
	<li>Use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/citingmedicine">Citing medicine: the NLM style guide for authors, editors, and publishers (2nd ed.) <span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>

	</ul>
	<p>The Vancouver referencing style is a <b>numbered system</b>, predominantly used in the medical field. Authorship is acknowledged using a number to represent a reference. From the in-text reference number, the reader may consult the reference list for full publication details.</p>

<!-- 312 General rules for in-text citations -->
<div id="infobox-answer-vanrules" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
<div class="panecontents">
	<h2>Using Vancouver</h2>
	<h3>General rules for in-text citations</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>References are numbered consecutively in the order in which they first appear in the text. For example, the first source is given the number 1, the second source 2, and so on.</li>
	<li>Once you have given a source a number, use the same number whenever you refer to that source in the text.</li>
	<li>Identifying numbers are placed outside the sentence punctuation. In the text, the number appears in parentheses (either round or square) or as superscript. Examples:</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>
	<p>The theory was first put forward in 1987. (1)</p>
	<p>The theory was first put forward in 1987. [1]</p>
	<p>The theory was first put forward in 1987.<sup>1</sup></p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
	<p>Paraphrasing is when you use someone else's ideas or research and express them in your own words. The way you cite the information depends on the emphasis you wish to apply.</p>
	<p><b>Information-prominent citations</b> emphasise the information you have paraphrased or quoted from an author:</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>. . . as evidenced from a recent Australian study. (1)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><b>Author-prominent citations</b> emphasise the author. Note: When citing a reference with <b>multiple authors</b>, list the first author, and then abbreviate subsequent authors using <b>et al.</b></p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>In his research, Jones (2) asserts that . . .</p>
	<p>Morton et al. (2) suggest that the use of binomial control charts . . .</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h4>Direct quotes</h4>
	<p>Direct quotes are rarely used in the Vancouver style. However, if you use the exact wording of a source:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>include the page number in the in-text citation</li>
	<li>enclose short direct quotes within quotation marks</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Within the parentheses, the in-text number is followed by a space, then the lower case letter 'p' with no space and the page number.</p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>"The increasing availability and growth rate of biomedical information, also known as ‘big data’, provides an opportunity for future personalized medicine programs that will significantly improve patient care". (1 p433)</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Quotes longer than four lines should be <b>indented</b> in a block, in <b>reduced type</b> and <b>without quotation marks:</b></p>
	<blockquote><blockquote>
	<p style="font-size: 0.875em;">With the increased need to store data and information generated by big projects, computational solutions, such as cloud-based computing, have emerged. Cloud computing is the only storage model that can provide the elastic scale needed for DNA sequencing, whose rate of technology advancement could now exceed Moore's Law. Moore's law is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors on integrated circuits and the speed of computers double approximately every 2 years. (1 p433)</p>

<!-- 313 Citing multiple references -->
<div id="infobox-answer-vancitemultiple" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using Vancouver</h2>
		<h3>Citing multiple references at the same point in-text</h3>
		<p>When citing more than one reference at the same point in your text, give the relevant numbers, separated by commas. Include one space between the comma and the next number:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A number of researchers (4, 5) discovered that . . .</p>
			<p>A number of researchers (3, 6, 10) discovered that . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If the references have <b>consecutive numbers</b>, then use a hyphen. There should be no spaces between numbers and hyphens:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>A number of researchers (4-7) discovered that . . .</p>
		</blockquote>

<!-- 314 General rules for the reference list -->
<div id="infobox-answer-vanrulesreflist" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using Vancouver</h2>
		<h3>General rules for the reference list</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>On a new page, under the heading 'Reference List’, list the publication details of all your in-text references. The reference list should be at the end of your document.</li>
			<li>List references numerically in the order they first appear in the text.</li>
			<li>Include only those works cited in the text. List all other sources you have used separately under the heading ‘Bibliography’.</li>
			<li>Format the reference list to be single-spaced with one line space between each entry.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Titles</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not use italics for any titles, e.g. book titles, journal titles, titles of journal articles.</li>
			<li>For book titles and journal article titles, capitalise the first word and proper nouns only (i.e. use minimal capitalisation).</li>
			<li>For journal titles, use an abbreviated format. To find the title abbreviation, go to the PubMed database, select "Journals in NCBI Datbases", and then enter the journal’s full title to display its abbreviation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Authors</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>For authors, begin with the family name followed by the initial(s). There are no spaces or full stops between initials (e.g. Smith AB).</li>
			<li>Where there are six or fewer authors, list all the authors.</li>
			<li>If there are more than six authors, list the first six followed by <b>et al.</b></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Place of publication</h4>
		<p>For the place of publication, add the city, and then qualify it – see below – by the state code or country name.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Cities in the USA and Canada:</b> Include the two-letter abbreviation for the state or province, e.g. St Louis (MO); Hamilton (ON).</li>
			<li><b>Cities in other countries:</b> Use either the country name after all cities not in the USA or Canada, e.g. Melbourne (Australia); Oxford (England).</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Pagination</h4>
		<p>For books in the Reference List, pagination (i.e. total number of pages) is optional. <i>Note: The examples in this guide do not include pagination for books.</i></p>
		<h4>Punctuation for references ending with a URL</h4>
		<p>End citations with a full stop unless the citation ends with a URL or other electronic address.</p>
		<p>Check:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the URL ends with a forward slash, end the citation with a full stop.</li>
			<li>If the URL does not end with a forward slash, do not end the citation with a full stop.</li>
		</ul>

<!-- 341 Images General rules -->
<div id="infobox-answer-vanimagesrules" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Images</h2>
		<h3>General rules</h3>
		<p><b>General rules</b></p>
		<p>In the Vancouver style, the term “illustration” applies to anything that is not written. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>images (labelled as "Figures" when included in-text)</li>
			<li>tables</li>
			<li>charts</li>
			<li>graphs</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The following are general rules for citing illustrations – whatever the type - using the Vancouver referencing style. However, the specific examples provided in this Vancouver guide are for citing images.</p>
		<p><b>Using numbers</b></p>
		<p>The Vancouver referencing style uses Arabic numerals, e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc., whenever a number is required. Do not use:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Roman numerals, e.g. i, ii, iii</li>
			<li>words, e.g. one, two, three</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>In-text citations</b></p>
		<p>Below the illustration you have inserted in your text, add a caption that includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a label and number. The number will depend on where it appears in your text.  E.g. If it is the first figure in your text, it will be labelled Figure 1.</li>
			<li>the description or title used in the original source</li>
			<li>a reference number in parentheses. This is the number that you give it according to where it appears in your text. For example, if it is the 12th source cited in your document, the reference number will be (12).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>The reference list</b></p>
		<p>In the reference list, include the sources of all the illustrations that you have used from another source and inserted in your text.</p>
		<p>In general, this is the order that the references in your list will include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the reference number you gave a reference in-text</li>
			<li>the standard reference structure for the particular reference type source (e.g. a book)</li>
			<li>the figure number that was used in that original source</li>
			<li>the title of the illustration</li>
			<li>the page number where the illustration is located in the source (if available or applicable)</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>Images not numbered in the original source, e.g. image on a webpage or in a database</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the illustration is not numbered, give it a number according to its placement on the webpage and enclose it in square brackets. For example, if it is the first illustration in the original source, give it the number 1, e.g. [Figure 1].</li>
			<li>If it is the only illustration given in the original source, just use [Figure].</li>

		<h3>Student's own work</h3>
		<p>You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice.  Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.</p>
		<p>Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.</p>
		<p>Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment 			Declaration</a>.</p>
		<p>The publication <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/">Citing Medicine</a> on which this information is based does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following is 			based on how to cite dissertations and theses.</p>
		<p>If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.</p>
		<p><b>Paraphrasing in-text</b></p>
			<p>For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Studies indicate that … (24).</p>
					<p>Smith (24) noted that …</p>
				</blockquote>
			<p>If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it 			may look like this:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>According to Smith (24), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (18) …</p>
				</blockquote>
		<p><b>Direct quote in-text</b></p>
			<p>Place direct quotes between double quotation marks "  " and provide the page number from the previous work.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders". (24 p3).</p>

		<h3>Introduction to the IEEE referencing style</h3>
		<p><b>Important:</b> This is a guide only. To avoid losing marks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Confirm the referencing requirements of your School with your lecturer, and</li>
			<li>Use <i>IEEE Reference Guide</i>, Piscataway, NJ, USA: IEEE Periodicals, 2020. [Online]. Available: <a target="_blank" href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf">https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf <span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>
			<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-edit fa-external-link"></i></a> to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on this publication.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) citation style is a <b>numbered</b> style where references are numbered [1], [2], [3] in-text and so on in the order of appearance in the body of the document. A <b>Reference List</b> at the end of the work provides full details of all references cited in-text. The references are ordered as they appear in the in-text references (in order of citation, not in alphabetical order). You need to follow this style when acknowledging your information sources.</p>

<!-- 412 General rules for in-text citations -->
<div id="infobox-answer-ieeerules" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using IEEE</h2>
		<h3>General rules for in-text citations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In your writing, you must acknowledge each author or source of information (whether print or online) either by <b>paraphrasing</b> or using a <b>direct quote</b>.</li>
			<li>References that are cited in-text MUST appear as a number within square brackets, and need to come before any punctuation with a space before the bracket.</li>
			<li>Numbered references used in-text MUST start at [1] and continue in <b>ascending</b> order within the body of the work.</li>
			<li>Once a source has been cited and allocated a reference number, the same reference number MUST be used throughout the body of a work if it’s referred to multiple times.</li>
			<li>Numbered citations may be treated grammatically as footnote numbers in the text e.g. As demonstrated by Smith [5] . . . OR, For further details, see [1], [5], [7].</li>
			<li>Numbered citations may also be treated as nouns in the text e.g. According to [7] . . . OR, As mentioned in [4], [5], [6]-[8] . . . (note the use of the <b>en dash</b> symbol ‘–’ between a source range).</li>
			<li>The <b>en-dash</b> symbol should be used between a source range e.g. [6]-[8]. The en-dash is wider than the hyphen and can be typed by holding down <b>Alt + 0150</b> on the numeric keypad.</li>
			<li>List all <b>multiple citations</b> in ascending numerical order e.g. [1], [5], [6]-[8] or as [1,5], [6-8].</li>
			<li>It is NOT necessary to mention either the author(s) or dates of any work cited in-text.</li>
			<li>If referring to authors in the body of the text, then all author family names must be listed up to <b>two</b> authors. If there are <b>three or more</b> authors, then cite only the family name of the first author followed by <b><i>et al.</i></b> for the first and subsequent citations.</li>
			<li>When directly quoting, that is using the exact words that an author has used, you must enclose the quote in double quotation marks <b>“ ”</b> and allocate a citation number along with the page number(s) in square brackets.</li>
			<li>In your writing, <b>acronyms</b> should be written out in full the first time referred to, followed by the acronym in parentheses. For subsequent occurrences, the use of the acronym is acceptable. See the <b>Abbreviations</b> section for more details.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Paraphrasing</h4>
		<p>Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words. When paraphrasing, it’s acceptable to include only the citation as a number in square brackets, or as a number along with the author’s family name as part of your sentence.</p>
		<p><i>Note: When paraphrasing, the citation details can be placed at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.</i></p>
		<h4>Citation at the beginning</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Benson [1] states that thermal performance . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Citation in the middle</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>. . . not only does the shift toward multicore processors mean more improvements in CPU speed [1], but they also consume less power and produce less heat.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Citation at the end</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>. . . and therefore the rate of heat transfer slows [1].</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>Note: Citations can also be structured according to whether they give prominence to the author, or to the information being conveyed.</i></p>
		<h4>Author-prominent citations</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In his research on software thermal management, Benson [1] claims that . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Information-prominent citations</h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>. . . where more processors are being produced to optimise power and thermal performance [1].</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Including page numbers in a paraphrase citation</h4>
		<p>When paraphrasing, page numbers are not usually used as part of the citation, unless it intends to help the reader to locate the source of the information in a lengthy or complex document.</p>
		<p><i>Note: Including page numbers when paraphrasing is optional, and is NOT a requirement of the IEEE referencing style.</i></p>
		<h4>Direct quotes</h4>
		<p>Direct quotes are used when you are using the exact words of the author(s). Put direct quotes between double quotation marks “ ” and add both the citation number followed by a comma, and the page number(s), preceded by <b>p.</b> (for a single page) or <b>pp.</b> (for multiple pages). <b>Do not overuse direct quotes!</b>.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Due to the nonlinear nature of the Law of Dynamic Power, if the demand on the processor is light, the operating frequency can be reduced to save clock cycles, reducing power and limiting heat generation" [1, p. 82].</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Citing a source with no page number(s)</h4>
		<p>If the work you are referencing does NOT contain page numbers, then use chapter numbers, section headings and paragraph numbers as part of the in-text reference.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"Many physical dynamic systems can be represented and modeled by first-order differential equations" [1, Ch. 3, para. 1].</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Omitting words from a direct quote</h4>
		<p>If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots ( . . . ) and another space.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>"The third basic electrical element is the inductor . . . Generally, the induced voltage <i>v</i> in an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of current <i>i</i>" [1, p. 168].</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><i>Note: Quotes longer than <b>three lines</b> are strongly discouraged, and should be avoided.</i></p>

		<h3>Citing the same reference multiple times</h3>
		<p>If citing the same reference within the body of the text, then use the same citation number throughout the text. IEEE does NOT allow for the use of terms such as “ibid.” or “op. cit.” when citing the same reference multiple times. Instead, if the same source is cited multiple times, then it is preferable to distinguish between these with reference to the appropriate section, for example:</p>
		<ul>

<!-- 417 General rules for the reference list -->
<div id="infobox-answer-ieeerulesreflist" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using IEEE</h2>
		<h3>General rules for the reference list</h3>
		<h4>General rules</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a reference list to include all of the publications you have acknowledged at the end of your work, and use the heading <b>References</b> or <b>Reference List</b> on a new page.</li>
			<li>The reference list is arranged in an ascending numbered sequence such as [1], [2], [3] and so on, and MUST be presented in the order in which they appear in the body of the text.</li>
			<li>Reference list numbers should be positioned flush against the left page margin, and the citation details MUST appear on the same line, and be indented.</li>
			<li>IEEE requires some words, months, publisher names, conference proceedings and journal titles to be abbreviated where appropriate – see <b>Abbreviations</b> section for further details.</li>
			<li><b>Publisher names</b> in the reference list can be abbreviated or an acronym can be used e.g. WHO may be used instead of World Health Organization.</li>
			<li>Do NOT abbreviate or use acronyms for <b>corporate/organisation author names</b> e.g. CSIRO should be written out as Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in the reference list.</li>
			<li>Capitalise and italicise titles where appropriate.</li>
			<li>Do NOT combine references – only one reference per number. See <b>Example of a reference list</b> section for formatting details.</li>
			<li>Include a retrieval statement in the form of a URL (where possible) if the reference is taken from an electronic or online source, or alternatively, where stated in the rules, a database name. There is <b>no</b> full stop after a URL, and the URL should not be hyperlinked.</li>
			<li>Take care when editing any references, as this may require careful renumbering of sources cited both in-text and in the reference list.</li>
			<li>The Reference List is to be formatted using 1.5 line spacing and single paragraph spacing between each citation. For clarification see your lecturer.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Digital object identifier (DOI)</h4>
		<p>When citing electronic sources such as e-journal articles or e-books, you <b>MUST</b> include a digital object identifier (DOI) if stated. A DOI is a unique identifier that is assigned to certain electronic sources, and provides a persistent link to online content.</p>
		<p>The DOI can be added to the reference list using the following formats:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>1.	doi:xx.xxxxxxxxxxxx.</p>
			<p>2.	http://dx.doi.org/xxxxxxxxxxxxx.</p>
			<p>3.	https://doi.org/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If no DOI is assigned, include either the journal/database homepage URL if taken from a library database, or the full URL if taken from a source on the open web.</p>
		<p><i>Note: A full stop should appear at the end of the DOI.</i></p>
		<h4>Place of publication</h4>
		<p>For the place of publication, add the city, and then include the state code (if applicable) and country name, followed by the publisher and year of publication.</p>
		<p>Cities in the USA need the city name, state abbreviation and country abbreviation.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Boston, MA, USA: Cengage Learning, 2017.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Cities in the UK need the city name and country abbreviation.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Oxford, U.K.: Newnes, 2012.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Cities in other countries (outside the USA and UK) just need to include the city name and country.</p>

		<h3>Student's own work</h3>
		<p>You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.</p>
		<p>Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.</p>

		<p>The publication, <i>IEEE Reference Guide</i> (2020) does not provide guidelines on how to cite your own work. The following examples show how to cite your own work that you have previously submitted for assessment.</p>
		<p>If you cite or quote your own previous work, treat yourself as the author and the title of your previous assessment as an unpublished paper.</p>
		<h4>Paraphrasing in-text</h4>
		<p>When paraphrasing, include the citation number in square brackets. Or, if referring to your family name in the body of the text, then include the citation number in square brackets immediately after your family name.</p>
		<p>For example, if Brad Smith wanted to cite a paper they wrote at RMIT University in 2019, their in-text reference may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Studies indicate that . . . [9].</p>

<div id="infobox-answer-chicagogeneralrulesreferencelist" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Using Chicago author-date</h2>
		<p>Use a reference list to include all of the publications you have acknowledged at the end of your work, and use the heading <b>References</b> or <b>Reference List</b> on a new page.</p>
		<h3>General rules for the reference list</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All sources appearing in the reference list must be ordered <b>alphabetically by surname</b> of the first author, or title if no author is identified.</li>
			<li>The name of the first author is inverted (i.e., Charles Dickens to Dickens, Charles); subsequent author’s names are given in the form in which they appear in the original source publication.</li>
			<li>The bibliography should be <b>double spaced</b> and <b>hanging indents</b> used for each entry. A hanging indent is where the first line starts at the left margin and subsequent lines are indented about 5 spaces. There are no line spaces between references.</li>
			<li><i>Italics</i> is the preferred format for titles of books, journals and videos. Article and chapter titles are put in double quotation marks.</li>
			<li><b>Capitalisation</b> within the Chicago style requires all major words to be first letter uppercase.</li>

<!-- 585 Students own work -->
<div id="infobox-answer-chicagoothersourcesstudentsownwork" class="infobox-slidingpane infobox-answerpane">
	<div class="panecontents">
		<h2>Other sources</h2>
		<h3>Student's own work</h3>
		<p>You should include the use of scholarly sources in your written assessments to adhere to best academic integrity practice. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.</p>
		<p>Note: Check first with your lecturer, or teacher, if it is permissible to cite your previously submitted work.</p>
		<p>Remember that when submitting work, you will be asked to agree to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/assessment/assessment-declaration">Assessment Declaration. <span class="sr-only">Opens in new window</span>
			<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-edit fa-external-link"></i></a>
		<p>If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished paper.</p>
		<h4>Paraphrasing in-text</h4>
		<p>When paraphrasing, include your family name and year of previous work in brackets. Or, if referring to your family name in the body of the text, then just include the year of previous work in brackets immediately after your family name.</p>
		<p>For example, if Jane Smith wanted to cite a paper she wrote at RMIT University in 2018 her in-text reference may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Studies indicate that . . . (Smith 2018).</p>
			<p>Smith (2018) noted that . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If your original work contained citations from other sources, you would need to include those same citations in the new work as well. If Jane Smith's earlier paper had cited Presley and Johnson, for example, it may look like this:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>According to Smith (2018), psychologists such as Presley and Johnson (2009) . . .</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Direct quote in-text</h4>
		<p>Place direct quotes between single quotation marks ' ' and provide the page number from the previous work.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>'Risk taking behaviours align neatly with certain personality traits or disorders' (Smith 2018, 3).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Reference list</h4>
		<p>In the Reference list include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Student name</li>
			<li>Year of previous work</li>
			<li>Title of previous work (between double inverted commas)</li>
			<li>Unpublished paper</li>
			<li>Institution name</li>
			<li>Location (if not inferred by University name)</li>
		</ul>
		<blockquote>
