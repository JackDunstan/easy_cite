### Government report

An author can be a person, a group of persons (a committee or named individuals), a government department or a government agency.

Government departments and agencies may be cited in-text using their acronym; in which case the matching reference list entry must also use the acronym in place of the organisation-as-author, followed by the full name in brackets; the reference list entry must be alphabetised using the abbreviation (rather than the spelled-out name), as in the ARC example.

However, where an organisation is commonly known by its acronym (such as CSIRO, Qantas, NASA), list the acronym in the reference list without the full name in brackets, as in the CSIRO example.

The publisher and author should be recorded as they appeared when the document was originally published. Do not alter the name of the government department or agency if they have changed since it was published.
