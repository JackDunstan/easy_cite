**Important: this is a guide only.** To avoid losing marks:

- Confirm referencing requirements your lecturer
- Use The Chicago Manual of Style. 17th ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2017 to clarify referencing rules or if you need more examples. This guide is based on the 17th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style.
- Additional information on Chicago referencing for students can be found within: A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations : Chicago Style for Students and Researchers 9th. edition

The University of Chicago has developed several editions of the Chicago Manual of Style to aid authors in the preparation of manuscripts, which include referencing styles.

There are two systems outlined by the Chicago referencing style: **Author-Date** and **Notes-Bibliography**.

This guide use examples in the **author-date** system. The author-date system requires in-text citations within the assignment, along with a full bibliographic entry in the reference list at the end of the assignment.

### General rules for in-text citations

- Use in-text citations to acknowledge each author or source of information used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.
- Paraphrasing is the expression of the ideas of others by rephrasing the original text in your own words. For further information on paraphrasing please see [Learning lab: Guide to paraphrasing](https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/paraphrasing) (opens in a new window)
- Direct quoting involves using the exact wording used by the original author(s) in your work; this is indicated by quotation marks. For further information on direct quoting please see [Learning Lab: Guide to inserting references](https://emedia.rmit.edu.au/learninglab/content/inserting-references) (opens in a new window)
- For specific advice on each reference you must determine the type of resource ie. book, journal article etc. and follow the recommended advice within this guide.
- In the Chicago Author Date style, in-text paraphrased citations are entered in two ways:
    - 'Information prominent' (the author's name is within the parentheses)
    - 'Author prominent' (the author's name is outside the parentheses)

> The conclusion reached in a recent study.. (Cochrane 2021)
> 
> Cochrane (2021) concluded...

- In the Chicago Author Date style, to add a direct quote in your work, copy the exact words from the original source. Use quotation marks " " at the beginning and end of the original source. Cite the author year and page number information.

> Reflective writing in a learning journal can increase metacognition by "assisting students to develop greater self-awareness in terms of time management and learning style" (Lorenzi 2021, 3).

- When no author is available, in the text, a short version of the title (up to four words) may be used.
- When the publication date of a book or other work cannot be determined, the abbreviation n.d. takes the place of the year in the reference list entry and in-text citations. In-text, n.d. (no date) remains lowercased to avoid combining with the author’s name. e.g. (Smith n.d.) or Smith (n.d.) notes that … or (Smith n.d., 5)
- Use a page number for direct quotes. You don’t need a page number when paraphrasing.
- Page number(s) must be cited when using a direct quote. Add a comma then the page number(s). Example: (White 2011, 43).
- Paraphrased in-text citations from a chapter or other part of an edited book, include the chapter author(s) and year (Baldwin 2021).
- In-text direct quote citations, from a chapter or other part of an edited book, include the chapter author(s), year and specific chapter page. Example: (Baldwin 2021, 46).
- For references with multiple authors see Multiple Authors section of this Chicago Easy Cite guide.
- When editors, translators, or compilers are used as the author, do not include their role (trans., ed., comp.) in the in-text citation.
- When the reference list has works by authors with same last name, include their first initial in the in-text citation. Example: (A. Nelson 2015) (B. Nelson 2013).
- If an author has published multiple works in the same year, alphabetise the titles in the reference list and then add a, b, c, etc. to the year. (Example: Dickens 2008a) (Dickens 2008b).
- To cite more than one reference in a single in-text citation, separate the citations by semicolons. Example: (Dickens 2008; Lee 1998) If the works are by the same author, use just the year and separate with a comma.

### General rules for the reference List

Use a reference list to include all of the publications you have cited at the end of your work, and use the heading **References** or **Reference List** on a new page.

- All sources appearing in the reference list must be ordered **alphabetically by surname** of the first author, or title if no author is identified.
- The name of the first author is inverted (i.e., Charles Dickens to Dickens, Charles); subsequent author’s names are given in the form in which they appear in the original source publication.
- When the publication date of a book or other work cannot be determined, the abbreviation n.d. takes the place of the year in the reference list entry.
- The reference list should be **double spaced** and **hanging indents** used for each entry. A hanging indent is where the first line starts at the left margin and subsequent lines are indented about 5 spaces. There are no line spaces between references.
- The elements in the reference are separated by full stops and not commas.
- *Italics* is the preferred format for titles of books, journals and videos. Article and chapter titles are put in double quotation marks.
- **Capitalisation** within the Chicago style requires all major words to be first letter uppercase (headline case).
- For articles consulted online, include a URL or the name of the database in the reference list entry. Many journal articles list a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). A DOI forms a permanent URL that begins https://doi.org/. This URL is preferable to the URL that appears in your browser’s address bar
- If the article/ebook/online source can only be accessed with an account login, provide the web address of the publisher's homepage or provide the database name.
- If there are four or more authors, you may list up to ten in the reference list. For more than ten authors, list the first seven in the reference list, followed by et al. See further advice on multiple authors in the Multiple Author section of this guide.

### General rules for multiple authors

#### Two to three authors

##### In-Text Citation

List up to three authors in both the citation and the reference list. For four or more authors, list only the first followed by et al. in the citation and all in the reference list (see four or more authors below).

If directly quoting from a source without a page number, use a paragraph number instead.

**Use a page number for direct quotes. You don’t need a page number or paragraph number when paraphrasing.**

For two authors, include First Author’s Family Name and Second Author’s Family, Year of Publication, Page or Pages.

(Author's Family Name and second Author's Family Name Year of publication, page number)

> Lai and Bakshi (2021, para. 2) state that “subcultures have been allowed to flourish online.”

For three authors, separate the first two author family names by a comma, then include ‘and’ last family name, followed by year and page number.

(Author Family Name, Author Family Name, and Author Family Name year, page).

> Megginson, Byrd, and Megginson (2000, 35) assert that "market research…

##### Reference List

Abbreviations for editor (ed.) or translator (trans.) are not included in in-text citations but are included in the reference list.

List authors in the order in which they appear in the source. The first-listed name is inverted - Family Name, Given Name. The rest of the names are written as - Given Name Family Name.

For two authors: Family Name, Given Name, and Given Name Family Name. Year etc.

### One source quoted or paraphrased in another (Secondary citation)

Use a secondary citation to acknowledge the work of an author(s) that has been directly quoted or paraphrased in another author(s) work.

According to the Chicago Manual of Style, consulting and referencing primary sources is always preferable. However if the primary source is only available in a secondary source, then introduce the primary source in the text and note that the source is "quoted in" or "cited in" the secondary source in the citation.

#### In-Text Citation: Direct Quote

- Remember to include both sources.

If you wish to use a quote by Zukofsky, reproduced in an article by Costello, in your assignment:

You would acknowledge Zukofsky in the text and add the secondary citation (quoted in Author Family Name Year, Page number):

> In Louis Zukofsky's "Sincerity and Objectification," from the February issue of Poetry magazine, he states that Marianne Moore’s work “is largely a portrait of the author’s character intent upon the presentation which is sincerity, rather than the revealed rest of objectification...”(quoted in Costello 1981, 78).

#### In-Text Citation: Paraphrase

- Remember to include both sources.

If you read an article by Barbraud, in which he cites information from a previous study by Jones, and you wish to refer to this information in your assignment:

You would acknowledge Jones in the text and add the secondary citation (cited in Author Family Name Year):

> Jones' 2019 study, published in volume 42 of Polar Biology (cited in Barbraud 2021), found that the giant petrel sea bird is common in Antarctic waters...

#### Reference list

- According to the Chicago Manual of Style 17th ed. section 15.56 : cite only the secondary source in the reference list entry.

Follow the reference list rules for the type of resource you are citing ie. book, journal etc.

> Barbraud, Christophe, Baudouin Des Monstiers, Adrien Chaigne, Cédric Marteau, Henri Weimerskirch, and Karine Delord. 2021. "Predation by Feral Cats Threatens Great Albatrosses." *Biological Invasions* 23, no. 8: 2389-2405.
