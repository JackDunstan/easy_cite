### Webpages

- Chicago requires an access date in citations of websites and other sources consulted online only if no date of publication or revision can be determined from the source (see 14.12 of the Chicago Manual). In those cases that is, when only an access date is used record n.d. as the date of publication in the reference list entry and for the in-text citation. To avoid conflation with the name of the author, n.d. is always lowercase.

- Websites are created by individuals, companies, governments and other organisations. If no individual author is identified, use the organisation name as the author. If no organisation is identified either, use the webpage title in the place of the author name.

#### In-Text Citation: Direct quote

- If directly quoting from a source without a page number, use a paragraph number or section heading instead.

(Author’s Family Name or Organisation Year of publication, page number or paragraph number or heading name).

> "The facade is dramatic but also mysterious, faceless, presenting white-painted brick and pine battens and with no visible openings" (Scrubt 2017, para. 3).

### Web documents

- Use for stand-alone documents that are downloaded from a website.

- If page numbers are not given, use paragraph number or section headings.

- Web documents are created by individuals, companies, governments and other organisations. If no individual author is identified, use the organisation name as the author. If no organisation is identified either, use the webpage title in the place of the author name.

- If no publication date can be identified, use n.d. in lowercase in place of a year in both the intext citation and the reference list.

### Social Media

As social media content is usually untitled, use the text of the post itself (up to 160 characters) in place of a title.

If an author's screen-name is available, include it in parentheses after their name. If only the screen-name is known, use that instead of the author's name.

Include the name of the social media site, and if relevant, include the type of post (photo, video) as in the Twitter example below.

Social media comments should be cited in reference to the related post.

Private content, including direct messages, should be cited as personal communication.
