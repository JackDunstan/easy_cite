### Student's own work

- Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

- Check first with your lecturer or teacher if it is permissible to cite your own previously submitted work.

- Using parts of your old assignments in new assignments without referencing is self-plagiarism.

If you copy and paste parts of your old assignments, make sure you reference them the same way you would reference any other source.

If you cite or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous course work as an unpublished manuscript.
