- The initial *The* from the name of the newspaper can be omitted.

### Newspaper article (online/database)

Newspaper titles are italicised.

Omit the initial *The* for English language newspaper titles. For example, (*Guardian* 2022).

If a newspaper article has no author listed, the title of the newspaper stands in place of the author and is italicised, followed by the year of publication. For example, (*New York Times* 2012).

For articles consulted online, include a URL or the name of the database in the reference list entry.

If the article can only be accessed with an account login, provide the web address of the publisher's homepage or provide the database name.

Many journal articles list a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). A DOI forms a permanent URL that begins https://doi.org/. This URL is preferable to the URL that appears in your browser’s address bar.

Sources such as webpages or online newspaper articles do not always include page numbers - for such unpaginated works, it may be appropriate to cite a paragraph number or section heading for in-text citations. For example, Smith (2018, para. 2) notes...
