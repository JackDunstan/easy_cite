### Websites

Enclose the title of the page in quotation marks. If there is no discernible title, create a short description of the website or webpage instead. The words *website* or *webpage* in parenthesis can be included after the title if the source is otherwise unclear.

Include a publication date or date of revision if this is available. However,it might be difficult to find a publication or revision date on websites. If this is the case, leave out the publication date as in the Tate Modern example below. For frequently updated webpages, you may include a last modified date with a time stamp, as in the Wikipedia example.

### Blog post

Chicago defines a blog as a web-based forum that consists of posted entries organised by date or topic and usually accompanied by comments.

Unless the word blog is already part of the title, as in the LSE Impact Blog example below, the blog title should be followed word *blog*, in parentheses. Titles of blog posts are placed in quotation marks.

Blogs that are part of a larger publication should also include the name of that publication as in the LSE example below.

Comments can usually be cited in the text, in reference to the related post. If the comment is cited in a note, list the name of the commenter and the date of the comment, followed by the information for the related post.

### Social media

As social media content is usually untitled, use the text of the post itself (up to 160 characters) in place of a title.

If an author's screen-name is available, include it in parentheses after their name. If only the screen-name is known, use that instead of the author's name.

Include the name of the social media site, and if relevant, include the type of post (photo, video) as in the Twitter example below.

To find a direct URL for a Facebook post, use the search function on the Facebook page to find the post and then copy the URL.

Social media comments should be cited in reference to the related post and in the shortened form.

Private content, including direct messages, is considered a form of personal communication.
