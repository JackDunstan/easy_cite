### General guidelines for visual materials

Visual materials can include illustrations, photographs, images, paintings, diagrams, maps and graphs.

Visual materials that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work. This can be done using a caption or a note.

Citations are also influenced by the location of where you found the image or creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than a reproduction.

Visual materials from books, articles and other sources that you refer to but don’t reproduce should be cited in the standard format of the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

Visual materials are not usually included in a bibliography. Some courses might request a list of illustrations or figures.

Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing illustrations and artworks. Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

### Captions

#### Using Captions

Captions are used to provide a description of illustrations, images and artworks. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as “Figure 7. Photograph by author” or “Figure 11. Initial sketches” might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. The word figure is always written in full and lower case, except when in parentheses when it is abbreviated (fig. 1).

#### Caption rule (Own work)

Figure number. Description or explanation.

##### Caption example

> Figure 1. Author’s photograph showing design development.

#### Caption rule (reproduced artwork)

Figure number. Artist’s Given Name Artist’s Family Name, *Title of work*, Year produced. Medium. Source - Publishing details of where you found it.

If the image was on a website include the URL, otherwise provide the source details as described in other areas of this guide.
