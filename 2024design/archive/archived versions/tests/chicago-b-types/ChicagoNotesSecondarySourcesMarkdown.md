### Secondary sources

To cite a source from a secondary source (“quoted in . . .”) is generally discouraged according the Chicago Manual of Style, since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed.

Both the original and the secondary source must be listed in the note and bibliography.

#### Rule for Note
