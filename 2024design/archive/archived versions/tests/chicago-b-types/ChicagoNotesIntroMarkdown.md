### Introduction

There are two formats of referencing within the Chicago Style. One is **notes and bibliography** and the other is **author-date** style. This guide provides examples and advice for **notes and bibliography only**. Notes and bibliography uses a numerical system of footnotes or endnotes. Footnotes require the writer to mark the in-text citation with a superscript number and provide a reference citation within the footnote. Throughout the document, citations are numbered in sequential order. A bibliography should be included at the end of the document, preferably in alphabetical order.

For examples and advice regarding **author-date style** of Chicago, please see [RMIT Easy Cite guide](https://www.lib.rmit.edu.au/easy-cite/).

**Footnotes/ Endnotes** : Footnotes or endnotes are numbered and correspond to note reference numbers in the text.

**Bibliography** : A bibliography is the term used for a list of resources consulted (e.g. books, articles, websites) when writing an assignment.

This guide is based on the Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition [The Chicago manual of style. 17th edition.](https://rmit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61RMIT_INST/1adn3cm/alma9921991311601341)

### General rules for Chicago notes - Footnotes and endnotes

Always check with your tutor or lecturer about any specific requirements they have around referencing.

Look at the example documents to view footnotes and endnotes in Microsoft Word.

#### Notes - Footnotes or Endnotes

- Each time you paraphrase, summarise, or use a direct quote in your paper, include a note to cite your source. A note can be a footnote or an endnote.

- A note number should be placed at the end of a sentence or clause, and after the punctuation.

- Footnotes can be found at the bottom of each page, i.e. in the footer, whereas endnotes are placed at the end of the document, chapter or section of writing.

- Notes require you to mark all in-text citations with a superscript number and provide a citation in the note. Notes should be numbered in sequential order.

- Previous editions of the Chicago Manual of Style recommended the use of *ibid.* (from *ibidem*, “in the same place”) when repeating a citation in footnotes. Unlike previous editions, the 17th ed. of the Chicago Manual of Style discourages the use of *ibid.* in favour of shortened citations.

- Chicago does not require you to include an access date unless no date of publication or revision can be determined from the source. However, you may wish to check with your lecturer first as they may have a preference for including access dates.

- The first line of your note should be indented .5" from the left of the page, or 5 spaces.

Example;

> {.footnote-indent}1. Doug Patt, *How to Architect (*Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press. 2012), 28.{/.footnote-indent}

**When do I use a shortened note?**

The first time you cite a source in a note,include all the recommended citation information. If you cite that same source again, use a shortened note.

- Author full-names are shortened to Family Name.

- Titles are shortened if longer than four words.

- Include the relevant page numbers.

- Include a note number.

- Ensure that the first line of your note is .5" from the left of the page, or 5 spaces.

Example;

> {.footnote-indent}2. Patt, *How to Architect,* 35.{/.footnote-indent}

#### Shortening a title

- The order of words should not be changed.

- Initial articles like “the” or “a” may be removed.

- Key words from the original title should be retained.

- Ensure the first part of the short citation matches what is listed in the bibliography.

- A short title is italicised or placed in "quotation marks" based on the full title.

#### Block quotations

- Block quotations should be used for quotes longer than five lines.

- Do not use quotation marks for block quotations.

- Block quotations are indented from the left (and sometimes from the right also).

- Block quotations require their own footnote.

- Quotation marks can be used within a block quotation when including a separate quote within the text.

#### Create a footnote in Word

1\. Place your curser at the end of the sentence, after the punctuation.

2\. Click ***References***.

3\. Select ***Insert Footnote***.

4\. A superscript number will appear in your text.

### General rules for Chicago bibliography

#### Basic rules to create a bibliography

- A bibliography includes all sources cited within the text, as well as any additional sources consulted.

- Place the bibliography at the end of your work on a new page.

- Title the page, *Bibliography,* and centre the title.

- Arrange the list of works in alphabetical order according to the family name of the author or editor.

- Author's names are inverted for the bibliography - Family Name, Given Name.

- Capitalise all titles.

- If the author is unknown, begin the reference with the title of work.

#### Create a hanging indent using Microsoft Word

The second line of each bibliography entry has a hanging indent.

##### To create a hanging indent in Microsoft Word;

1\.  Highlight all text (Shift + A).

2\.  Right click (Shift + F10).

3\.  Select ***paragraph***.

4\.  Under the heading, ***Indentation**,* select the drop-down box for ***Special*** and select ***Hanging***.
