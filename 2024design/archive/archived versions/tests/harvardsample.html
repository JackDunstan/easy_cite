<h4>General rules for in-text references</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Use in-text references to acknowledge each author or source of information (print or online) used within your writing either by paraphrasing or using a direct quote.</li>
			<li>In-text reference details include the author(s) family name (or company or organisation name, if the author is a company or organisation) and year of publication, with extra information if required, such as page numbers.</li>
			<li>An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.  If the author is integrated as part of the sentence, only the date (and page number for direct quote) is in parentheses immediately after the author's name.</li>
			<li>Use an ampersand (&amp;) when listing authors in parentheses. For example: (Lewis &amp; Lewis 2015). Use the full word 'and' when mentioning an author(s) in a sentence. For example: Lewis and Lewis (2015) ... .</li>  
			<li>When a work has two or three authors, always list all author(s) names every time the reference occurs in the text.</li>
			<li>When a work has four or more authors, list the first author(s) name followed by et al. For example: Haslam et al. (2013) ... or (Haslam et al. 2013).</li>
			<li>If the author of a reference is unknown, list the reference based on the title of the work.</li> 
			<li>If the publication date of a reference is unknown, use n.d.</li>
			<li>If the publication date is unknown but can be reliably estimated or inferred from the text then use c. (meaning 'circa') before the year</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Direct quote</h4>
		<p>A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the author(s).</p>
		<p>Do not overuse direct quotes.</p>
		<p>Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number.</p>
		<p>If no page number is available, include the location of the quote using a paragraph number or section heading. Abbreviate the word paragraph to para. with a period afterward.</p>
		<p>If you omit words from a direct quote, you will need to add a space followed by three ellipsis dots (...) and another space. For example: Cannon (2012, p. 165) argues that 'changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas ... will require coherent change strategies'.</p> 
		<p>An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.</p>
		<h5>Beginning of a sentence</h5>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Cannon (2012, p. 165) argues that 'changes in corporate approaches to such sensitive areas as hazard reduction, resource use, waste, pollution, etc. will require coherent change strategies'.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h5>Middle of a sentence</h5>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In a post about the emotions involved in undertaking a literature review, the Thesis Whisper (2013, para. 16) notes that 'elation when you realise you know more than your supervisor about your topic and you feel brave enough to argue about it' is one of the top five PhD emotions.</p> 
		</blockquote>
		<h5>End of a sentence</h5>
		<blockquote>
			<p>'Results broadly apply to managers in the tourism, hospitality, and service industries' (Hosany &amp; Martin 2012, Managerial implications section).</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>Block quotations</h4>
		<p>Quotes of more than 30 words in length are known as block quotations.</p>
		<p>Block quotes need to start on a new line, be indented from the text margin and set in smaller text size without single inverted commas (quotation marks).</p> 
		<p>At the end of the quote, include the reference details such as author name, year and page number(s) in parentheses.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Khoo's PhD research project in the area of architecture investigated:</p> 
			<blockquote>
				<p>the application of alternative multifunctional material systems with possible form-changing and responsive capacities. These are integrated with physical computational processes for responsive morphing architectural design as an ‘integrated’ and ‘synergetic’ entity identical to single moulded devices such as the solid-state door handles developed by the automobile industry (2013, p. 10).</p>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		<h5>Paraphrasing</h5>
		<p>Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.</p>
		<p>An in-text reference can be inserted at the beginning, middle or end of a sentence.</p>
		<h5>Beginning of a sentence</h5>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Ahmadjian (2006) noted that there has been disagreement over the influence of Japanese business groups on the economy.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h5>Middle of a sentence</h5>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Based on the novel of the same name, <em>Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky</em> (2010) follows the relationship between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h5>End of a sentence</h5>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The City of Melbourne's population increased by 10.5 percent in the period between July 2012 and June 2013 (Martin 2014).</p>
		</blockquote>
