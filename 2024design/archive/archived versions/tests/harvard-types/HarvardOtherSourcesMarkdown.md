### Lecture notes or course material

Material from your course may include lecture notes, PowerPoint slides, course handouts or micro-credentials. Where possible, try to use information from published material.

**Note:** Some courses and lecturers might not accept lecture notes or course material as references in assignments / assessment. Check with your lecturer or teacher.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. After the year, put a colon (:) followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

> The emphasis in week 3's lecture on the 'cultural and social background of employees as an important step in managing workplace diversity' (Tran 2022) led me to reflect on my own experiences in human resource management.

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

### Legal material

Take care to give accurate and complete details about legislation (Acts) and legal cases. The *Legal Material* section of the [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/referencing-and-attribution/legal-material) provides more detail and examples regarding the use of legal materials.

#### Legislation (Act)

When discussing government policies and services that require you to refer to the relevant law(s), the title of legislation (Act) is generally placed first, followed by the relevant subsections.

The title and year of the legislation (Act) is written in italics. The jurisdiction (e.g. Vic, Cth, etc.) is then identified – do not italicise. Include the jurisdiction either in the sentence (e.g. 'The Victorian government's...') or in parenthesis as an abbreviation after the Act title and without full stops (e.g. (Vic) ).

Depending on the context, you might need to refer to specific sections, paragraphs and subparagraphs using a pinpoint reference.

The units are written in lower case unless they begin a sentence. Units of an Act can be written in long or abbreviated form. Do not begin sentences with the abbreviated form.

##### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available) or pinpoint reference.

> Reportable matters under the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic) are an acknowledgement that 'the protection of children is the paramount consideration in the context of child abuse' (para 16B(1)(b)).

> Section 55 of the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) states that 'there is a guarantee that the goods are reasonably fit for any disclosed purpose, and for any purpose for which the supplier represents that they are reasonably fit'.

##### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Section 5A of the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic) outlines the principles for compliance with child safety standards.

> The principles for compliance with child safety standards are outlined in the *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic), s 5A.

> The Victorian government's introduction of the *Wage Theft Act 2020* was a response to...

> Multiple jurisdictions have laws pertaining to the management of water supply in the Murray-Darling Basin, including the *Water Act 1989* (Vic), *Natural Resources Management Act 2004* (SA) and *Water Act 2007* (Cth).

##### Reference list entry

In your reference list: For a piece of **legislation (Act)**, include the title of the Act and year in italics, followed by the abbreviated jurisdiction in parentheses (e.g. Vic, Cth, etc.). For example, 'Commonwealth' is abbreviated to (Cth). Do not italicise the jurisdiction.

**Rule**

> *Title of Act Year* (abbreviated jurisdiction).

**Examples**

> *Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005* (Vic).
> 
> *Water Act 2007* (Cth).

#### Legal case

For a legal case, include the name of the case (parties) in italics, followed by the year in parentheses (e.g. 1975, 2008). Then put the volume number of the report series (e.g. 133, 237), the report series abbreviation (e.g. CLR, FCR, IR, HCA, FCA, FWC), and the page number where the case begins (e.g. 1). Only italicise the case name, not the other sections.

With direct quotes, include the location of the quote using a page number (if available). To specify a page number, use the word **at** rather than **p**, e.g. 'at 72'.

##### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

> It was identified that '...' (*Beasley v Francis* (2008) 237 CLR 1 at 72).

##### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> The case examined...(*University of New South Wales v Moorhouse and Angus & Robertson (Publishers) Pty Ltd* (1975) 133 CLR 1).

##### Reference list entry

In your reference list: For a **legal case**, include the name of the case (parties) in italics, followed by the year in parentheses (e.g. 1975). Then put the volume number of the report series (e.g. 133), the report series abbreviation (e.g. CLR, FCR, IR, HCA, FCA, FWC), and the page number where the case begins (e.g. 1).

### Student's own work (previously submitted)

You should include scholarly sources in your assignments to adhere to best practice in academic integrity. Citing yourself as an authority on your own opinion should be avoided.

Referencing your own work is necessary to make sure you do not self-plagiarise.

If you paraphrase or quote your previous work, treat yourself as the author and your own previous work as an unpublished paper.

Do not cut-and-paste sentences or paragraphs from previous assignment. If you are reusing your ideas, reword them (paraphrase) and take care to contextualise them to your new assignment.

Include your family name and the year that you previously submitted the work.

**Note:** Check with your lecturer or teacher if it is permissible to reuse and cite work you have previously submitted.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. If your previously submitted work has a page number, put a colon (:) after the year followed by the page number. If no page number is available and the quote comes from written work, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

> 'Risk taking behaviours align with certain personality traits or disorders' (Smith 2021:13).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> An interview with a marketing manager at a leading women's fashion retailer revealed that...(Smith 2021).

> Smith (2021) previously found that...

If your original assignment contained critique or commentary about other sources that you base your ideas on in your new assignment, you should also include those citations in your new assignment. For example, if you had criticised Presley and Dietrich in your earlier paper that you previously submitted, you might have something like this:

> According to Smith (2021), the claims of Priestly and Dietrich (2009) are out-dated and do not apply to the case currently being examined.

> I have not included Priestly and Dietrich’s (2009) model in this analysis because I believe their claims are not relevant to current work practices (Smith 2021).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Put the title of your previous work in single inverted commas (quotation marks).

- Include type of work followed by the course code in square brackets: \[unpublished paper for course code\]. For example, \[unpublished paper for HRHR1001\].

- The location is the city of the University. Add only if it is not inferred by the University name.

##### Rule

> Student family name Initial (Year) 'Title of previous work' \[unpublished paper for course code\], Name of University, Location (if not inferred by university name).

##### Example

> Smith J (2021) 'An analysis of personality theory' \[unpublished paper for HRHR1001\], RMIT University, Melbourne.

### Case study

Case studies are not a publication or reference type. They are a type of writing found in various sources such as books, journal articles, websites, etc. Reference the case study according to the rules for the source in which it is found.

### Interview

**Face-to-face interviews** that you conduct yourself are considered personal communication and are therefore not included in the reference list.

**Published interviews** follow the same rules as the source that the published interview appears in. For example, if the interview appears in a television program or podcast, you reference the television program or podcast. Please refer to the relevant section(s) within this guide for how to reference the various sources.

The person cited in the in-text reference is treated as the author since they have primary responsibility for communicating the content you are referring to.

#### Reference list entry - Example

> Nabben K (16 June 2021) 'The Business: cryptocurrency special' \[video\], *ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)*, ABC iview website, accessed 30 November 2021. https<nolink>://iview.abc.net.au/video/NS2157H001S00

### Media release

The author can be an individual person or organisation.

In your in-text references, include the author's name (individual or organisation), followed by publication year (e.g. 2021).

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'RBA' rather than 'Reserve Bank of Australia'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. If the media release has a page number, put a colon (:) after the year followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The example below comes from a source that does not have page numbers:

> In a recent media statement, the Minister for Housing acknowledged that 'young people leaving state care are at much higher risk of homelessness and unemployment' (Office of the Premier of Victoria 2021).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> The Minister for Housing announced additional funding for youth accommodation that would be integrated with additional support service (Office of the Premier of Victoria 2021).

> The Australian economy is now moving into a recovery phase, according to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Phillip Lowe (2021), following the disruptions caused by the Delta outbreak.

#### Reference list entry

### Personal communication

Personal communication, such as face-to-face interviews, conversations, telephone calls, letters or emails, is only cited an in-text reference.

Information about personal communication must be included in the in-text reference. Include the type of personal communication (for example, personal conversation, email, interview, telephone conversation) and the date in a date month year format.

Personal communication is not published and therefore unavailable for verification. For this reason, it is **not** included in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. If the personal communication has a page number, put a colon (:) after the year followed by the page number. If no page number is available and the quote comes from a written source, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The examples below come from sources that do not have page numbers:

> My field placement supervisor commented '...' (Lee, personal communication, 14 May 2022)

> Rowlands (personal communication, 20 February 2022) stated...

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Ms Merrick, Melville Shire Council CEO, confirmed the accuracy of the claims by email on 25 April 2022.

#### Reference list entry

Since personal communication is not published and therefore unavailable for verification, it is not included in reference lists.

### Works in the original language (non-English)

For sources you read in a language other than English, follow the referencing requirements for the type of source you used (e.g. newspaper article, website, book, journal article).

List the title in the original language. If the original language uses a different alphabet or script from English, use the anglicised spelling.

Place the English translation in parenthesis after the original title.

Add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 5 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.
