### Blog or blog post

If the blog post does not have a person identified as the author, use name of blog instead (e.g. Welcome to Country). Sometimes, an organisation's name is the author.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. Blogs or blog posts, however, do not have page numbers. In this case, since no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

> In a post introducing the delights of Australian native food, Welcome to Country (2021) notes that if you have not 'explored Australian native Bush Food you are missing out on some incredible flavours, textures and nutritional benefits'.

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> Australian native ingredients are nutritionally rich with wonderful flavours and textures (Welcome to Country 2020).

> Mewburn (2020) identifies the complexities of writing in an academic style.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- For blog post, enclose the publication day, month and year in brackets after the author. If there is no author, enclose the publication day, month and year in brackets after blog name.

- After the blog's name, add accessed date (e.g. accessed 2 November 2021) followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

##### Rule (with author)

> Author's family name Initial (Day Month Year) 'Title of article: subtitle', *Name of Blog*, accessed Day Month Year. URL

##### Example

> Mewburn I (10 June 2020) 'Why academic writing sucks (and how we can fix it)', *The Thesis Whisperer*, accessed 31 November 2021. https<nolink>://thesiswhisperer.com/2020/06/10/why-academic-writing-sucks-and-how-we-can-fix-it/

### Social media post

For publicly accessible posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.

For social media accounts that are not publicly accessible (e.g. a private Facebook page), the social media post should be cited as personal communication, not as social media post.

If the author's name is an organisation, you can use the shortened name form for your in-text references in parentheses if the organisation uses it regularly and it has become commonly accepted, e.g. 'WHO' rather than 'World Health Organization'. This saves you space. The full name is provided in the reference list.

#### In-text reference: Direct quotes

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. Social media posts, however, do not have page numbers. In this case, since no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

Cite the author's name (the poster) and the year of publication as you would for other reference types. Make sure, however, the reader knows that it is a social media post by mentioning the post type in the sentence.

> Following the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Greta Thunberg's tweeted that 'the people in power don't need conferences, treaties or agreements to start taking real climate action. They can start today'. (Thunberg 2021a).

> In Greta Thunberg's Instagram post, she asserts that 'we can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive' (Thunberg 2021b).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.

> In her Facebook post on 14 November, Thunberg (2021c) mocked world leaders for their lack of leadership at the COP26 summit in Glasgow by accusing them of all talk and no action.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:
