Generally, conference papers are published within conference proceedings, either online or in hardcopy (print) format. In most cases, a conference paper (rather than the conference proceedings) will be used as a reference.

A direct quote is when you are using the exact words of the work. Put direct quotes between single inverted commas (quotation marks), and add a page number (if available).

For direct quotes, page numbers are only required when they are provided in the original work. After the year, put a colon (:) followed by the page number. If no page number is available, you can indicate the location of the quote in your writing.

The example below comes from a source that has a page number, i.e. 76:

> 'Students should engage in critical self-reflection regarding their ability to apply the theory they study to their future employment' (Rasmussen and Ngwenya 2021:76).

#### In-text reference: Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is when you are expressing the ideas of the author(s) in your own words.
