### Artwork

#### General rules for artworks

RMIT Harvard includes the following within the definition of an artwork:

- drawings, paintings, prints, sculpture and ceramics

- photographs

- posters and cartoons

- performance and ephemeral art

- digital works

- antiquities

- maps

Artworks that you use in your assignment or for study purposes do not need the copyright permissions that are required for publishing or commercial use. However, it is essential that you give credit to the creator of the work and reference it in your work.

When citing works of art in the text of your assignment, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the figure layout (caption).

Citations are also influenced by where you sourced the creative work. Where possible, cite the original rather than copies from a reproduction.

How you capture and include the artwork or image (e.g. screen shot, photograph, copy-and-paste) does not influence the way in which it is referenced. Cite the work based on where you sourced the work.

**Note:** Your lecturer may have specific requirements for referencing artworks. Any directions given by your lecturer must be followed, even if they differ from this guide.

#### Captions

Captions are used to provide a description of the artworks you use. These are usually placed below the illustration.

A figure number is used in the caption to identify each illustration. These figures are numbered sequentially in the order in which they appear and followed by a colon.

Illustrations you create of your own work are not usually referenced. However, a caption such as 'Figure 7: Photograph by author' or 'Figure 11: Initial sketches' might be appropriate when other illustrations in your assignment are referenced. Check your lecturer's requirements.

Make sure you refer to the figure in your writing and include the figure number. This can be in the sentence or in parentheses, for example (see Figure 1).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the figure above or below or on page 3.

**Note:**Your lecturer might require a specific long or short caption style. Whichever style you use, make sure you apply it consistently.

#### Captions (Own work)

##### Rule

> Figure number: Description or explanation

##### Examples

> Figure 1: Author’s photograph

> Figure 2: Initial sketches of the design

#### Short captions for reproduced works

If the image was on a website include the URL, otherwise provide the in-text referencing details as described in other areas of this guide.

##### Rule

> Figure number: Artist's full name (year produced) *Title of artwork* \[medium\], Name of museum/gallery, Location of museum/gallery or Publishing details of where image was sourced.

##### Examples

> Figure 3: Artist unknown (11-12th C) *Tapestry with Dragons and Flowers* \[Silk tapestry\], The Metropolitan Museum of Art, https<nolink>://www.metmuseum.org/art/ collection/search/39733?

(OR depending on source):

> Figure 3: Artist unknown (11-12th C) *Tapestry with Dragons and Flowers* \[Silk tapestry\], in Jaynes A and Liaw J (1968:37)

> Figure 4: Henry Burn (1861) *Swanston Street from the Bridge* \[oil on canvas\], National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne

> Figure 5: Mari (Maria Giovanna Colli) (2009) *Bilbao\_6: Guggenheim Museum Bilbao* \[photograph\], Flickr, Copyright 2009 by Mari, CC BY 2.0, accessed 13 December 2021 https<nolink>://www.flickr.com/ photos/ 52355315@N08/5757476385/in/album-72157626677144865/

#### In-text reference to artworks

Italicise the titles of individual artworks, keeping any capitalisation, numbering or punctuation as specified by the artist.

Include the artist, year of creation and title of the artwork in parentheses, if not mentioned in the sentence, when first mentioning the work.

If you use an image, refer to the figure number when you discuss the artwork.

##### Examples

> The exhibition *Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion Manifesto* displays the Chanel's (1925) little black dress in silk organza transformed black from being the colour of mourning to the height of chic and modernity (see Figure 7).

> The purchase of Pollock's (1952) *Blue Poles* created great controversy regarding the value of abstract art when it was purchased for the National Gallery of Australia.

> As illustrated in Figure 4, the painting *Swanston Street from the Bridge* (Burn 1861) depicts Melbourne's growth into a city of domes and spires.

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Your own unpublished work or artworks discussed without an image are not included in the reference list.

- Artworks viewed in person, such as at art galleries, museums and public spaces, are cited to acknowledge their influence on the development of your own ideas or work.

- Artworks that you reproduced from books, websites and other sources should be cited in the standard format the source as described in the other sections of this guide.

- If viewed online: add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 13 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

##### Rule

### Maps

RMIT Harvard identifies maps as a type of artwork. Please see section on **Artworks** for further details.

Maps taken from an online source can include:

- digitised maps that originate from a print source such as old maps and are made available in an electronic format by museums, galleries and libraries

- web maps that use satellite imagery and GPS data and are taken from online navigation and mapping sites such as Google Maps

When citing maps in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the figure layout (caption).

Refer to a figure by its assigned number, not as the figure above or below or on page 3.

#### Captions

##### Rule

> Figure number: Cartographer’s full name (year produced) *Title of map*, Publishing details of where image was sourced.

##### Examples

> Figure 7: James Kearney (1855) *Melbourne and its suburbs: map 1* \[digitised map\], SLV https://www.slv.vic.gov.au/search-discover/explore-collections-format/maps/maps-melbourne-city-suburbs

> Figure 8: *Plenty Road Bundoora 3083* by VicPlan, 2020, web map.

#### In-text references

> The map, *Melbourne and its suburbs: map 1* \[digitised map\] shows...(Kearney 1855).

> Figure 8: *Plenty Road Bundoora 3083* by VicPlan, 2020, web map.

> Figure 7 illustrates...(Kearney 1855).

> The web map, *Plenty Road Bundoora 3083* highlights...(VicPlan 2020).

> As shown in Figure 8,...(VicPlan 2020).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list:

- Add map title in italics.
- Add the accessed date (e.g. accessed 1
3 December 2021), followed by a full stop, a space then the URL. No full stop after URL.

##### Rule

### Tables and diagrams

When citing tables, graphs or other diagrams in the text of your work, you need to acknowledge them in two places:

1.  within the written body of your paper, as you would for a normal in-text reference, and
2.  in the table/figure layout (caption).

Label tables sequentially as Table 1, Table 2 and so on, followed by a colon. Other graphs and diagrams are labelled as Figures.

Include a title that describes or explains the information in the table or diagram. Note, this is not italicised.

Refer to a table or figure by its assigned number, not as the table or figure above or below or on page 3.

For tables, graphs and diagrams using published content, acknowledge the source below the table/figure number and title, on a new line.

#### Tables (your own work)

When the information is your own work based on data you have collected independently, for example, from your own research or experiments, label your table with a number and give a title to the work. Use standard font (no italics).

##### Example

> Table 1: Comparison of results from groups A, B and C

#### Tables (adapted from published material)

If you are using information gathered from published information but are presenting it in a table or figure that you have created, acknowledge the source as you would for paraphrased information in a caption.

When the table includes data from more than one source, you must cite all sources you relied on to create the table.

##### Rule

> Figure number: Title of table  
> Source: adapted from Publishing details of where the information was sourced

##### Examples

> Table 2: Reason why students plagiarise  
> Source: adapted from Bretag B, et al. 2020

> Table 3: Fluctuation in imports 2010 to 2020  
> Source: adapted from Mitchelton 2018; ABS 2019; DFAT 2020

#### Tables (reproduced from published material)

If you are using a table or graph that has been published elsewhere, acknowledge the source and provide the same details you would for quoted information.

##### Rule

> Figure number: Title of table  
> Source: Publishing details of where the information was sourced

##### Examples

> Table 4: Prison demographics in Australia  
> Source: AIHW 2018:1

> Figure 10: Buy now, pay later payments in Australia  
> Fisher, Holland and West 2021:61

#### In-text references

> Bretag et al. (2020) identified a number of factors that contributed to plagiarism as listed in Table 2.

> Fluctuations in the imports over the last decade are represented in Table 3.

> Table 4 highlights current prison demographics in Australia, based on data compiled by AIHW (2018).

#### Reference list entry

In your reference list, reference tables and diagrams in accordance with the source they appear in. For example, if the table or diagram appears in a book or journal article, you reference the book or journal article. Please refer to the relevant section(s) within this guide for how to reference the various sources.
